Prompt: tell me a story that takes place in the 1900s

It was a sunny spring morning in 1905 when the train pulled into Union Station in Washington, D.C. 
Anna clutched her small suitcase tightly as she stepped onto the crowded platform. 
Fresh from a small town in Ohio, she felt both nervous and excited to start her new life here. 
She had found work as a secretary for a young Congressman thanks to a family connection.

Anna's eyes widened at the loud noises and fast-paced energy of the capital city.
 Horse-drawn carriages clattered down busy streets next to the first few motorcars she had ever seen. 
 She craned her neck to glimpse the tip of the Washington Monument rising in the distance. 
 The sights and sounds were so different from back home.

After checking into the respectable boarding house where she would live, Anna set off to walk to the Congressional offices.
 She made sure to wear her most professional outfit - a long black skirt, white blouse with big sleeves, and a fashionable hat perched on her curled brown hair.
 When she arrived, the bustling office was abuzz with activity. Phones rang, typewriters clacked, and paper messengers rushed back and forth.
 She took a deep breath, ready to launch her career in this exciting new world of politics and progress.
