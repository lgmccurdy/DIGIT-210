You're thinking of Emily's old boyfriend,

firefighter Steve D'Marco.

Yeah, I'm firefighter Steve D'Mazio.

We're very different.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200242?t=614" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="614">00:10:14</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
But I do have a truck,

and I'm fixing it up.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200242?t=616" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="616">00:10:16</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200242?t=617" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="617">00:10:17</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
I created a dating app

for firefighters to meet me.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200242?t=620" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="620">00:10:20</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">

-<action>chuckles</action> Yeah.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200242?t=622" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="622">00:10:22</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Hey! We should create a dating app

for asexuals.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200242?t=626" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="626">00:10:26</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Why would asexuals want a dating app?

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200242?t=628" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="628">00:10:28</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Well, not all asexuals are aromantic.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200242?t=631" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="631">00:10:31</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
-Uh...

-Think of it this way.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200242?t=633" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="633">00:10:33</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
One could be: A, Romantic,

or B, Aromantic,

while also being A, Sexual, or B, Asexual.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200242?t=641" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="641">00:10:41</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
So you could be BB, or BA.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200242?t=644" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="644">00:10:44</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
As for me, see AB, see?

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200242?t=646" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="646">00:10:46</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Uh...

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200242?t=647" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="647">00:10:47</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
So, even within the one percent

of the population that's asexual,

there's an even smaller percentage

that is still looking

for romantic companionship.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200242?t=656" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="656">00:10:56</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Seems like a pretty thin user base

for an app.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200242?t=659" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="659">00:10:59</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
But without it, asexual romantics

might end up settling for just whatever

other asexual romantics they might meet,

even if they have nothing else in common.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200242?t=667" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="667">00:11:07</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
-Well, anyway--

-Yeah, but maybe it's good

if they have nothing in common

because then they can help each other grow

and change, and become fuller,

more well-rounded people.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200242?t=677" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="677">00:11:17</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Yeah, that's true.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200242?t=678" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="678">00:11:18</a>
