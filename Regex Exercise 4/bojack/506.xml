Last night, she went to see <i>A Doll's House</i>

with a couple girlfriends,

and now she has ideas.

<speech speaker="Speaker">
I emerged from my sanctum, this afternoon,

to discover that not only had she

not made me lunch,

which is a meal I need in order to live,

but she'd furthermore, locked herself

in the bedroom to weep... loudly.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=45" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="45">00:00:45</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Now, it's one thing for a woman to weep,

but when they do it at such a volume

you can hear it through the door,

then you know they're doing it

just for the attention.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=53" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="53">00:00:53</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Anyway, I was able to cobble together

a sandwich for myself,

so, I'm the real hero of the story.

It was a couple hours later

when I realized I was on a good run

with my novel.

I had this really interesting sentence

that kept going for pages and pages,

and I thought about how rare it is

to really get in the groove like that.

<speech speaker="Speaker">
How, most days, I can't concentrate

because my idiot child

is blasting the television,

and it suddenly dawned on me;

hot cock on a rock,

she never even picked up

the little noise and snot factory!

So, here I am, being your mother,

which I know is giving you all sorts

of mixed-up ideas about gender,

while your brain

is still loose and stupid.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=95" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="95">00:01:35</a>

Just remember,

if you become a queer later in life,

this isn't my fault!

Don't you sing no songs in your nightclub

act called, "My Daddy was My Mommy,"

while gazing longingly

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Sundays are the one day

that are just for me and my craft,

and still, you and the black hole

that birthed you

conspire to ruin it for me.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=122" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="122">00:02:02</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">

Just go back to writing?

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=124" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="124">00:02:04</a>

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=127" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="127">00:02:07</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
All because of you

and that brittle wisp of a woman

you made the mistake

of making your mother.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=133" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="133">00:02:13</a>

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=135" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="135">00:02:15</a>

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=137" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="137">00:02:17</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
It's just that...

you can't depend on women.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=140" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="140">00:02:20</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
You can't depend on anyone.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=142" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="142">00:02:22</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Sooner or later, you need to learn

that no one else

is gonna take care of you.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=145" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="145">00:02:25</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
That's what I learned

when I had to make my own sandwich.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=148" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="148">00:02:28</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
You can't rely on other people, BoJack.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=150" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="150">00:02:30</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
It's good for you to know that.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=152" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="152">00:02:32</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
And she's a good mother

for teaching you that.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=154" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="154">00:02:34</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">

<speech speaker="Speaker">
So, I stopped at a Jack in the Box,

on the way here,

and the girl behind the counter said,

"Hiya! Are you having an awesome day?"

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=228" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="228">00:03:48</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Not, "How are you doing today?"

No. "Are you having an awesome day?"

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=232" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="232">00:03:52</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Which is pretty shitty because it puts

the onus on me to disagree with her,

like if I'm not having an "awesome day,"

suddenly I'm the negative one.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=240" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="240">00:04:00</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Usually, when people ask how I'm doing,

the real answer is I'm doing shitty,

but I can't say I'm doing shitty

because I don't have a good reason

to be doing shitty.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=247" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="247">00:04:07</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
So if I say, "I'm doing shitty,"

then they say, "Why? What's wrong?"

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=250" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="250">00:04:10</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
And I have to be like,

"I don't know, all of it?"

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=253" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="253">00:04:13</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
So instead, when people ask how I'm doing,

I usually say, "I am doing so great."

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=258" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="258">00:04:18</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
But when this girl at the Jack in the Box

asked me if I was having an awesome day,

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=262" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="262">00:04:22</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
I thought, well, today

I'm actually allowed to feel shitty,

today I have a good reason,

so I said to her, "Well, my mom died."

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=268" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="268">00:04:28</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
And she immediately burst into tears.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=270" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="270">00:04:30</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
So, now I have to comfort her,

which is annoying,

and meanwhile, there's a line

of people forming behind me,

who are all giving me

these real judgy looks

because I made

the Jack in the Box girl cry.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=279" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="279">00:04:39</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
And she's bawling, and she's saying,

"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,"

and I'm like, "It's fine. It's fine.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=284" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="284">00:04:44</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
I mean, it's not fine,

but, you know, it's... fine.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=287" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="287">00:04:47</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
And I would like to order

a Double Jack Meal,

and I've kinda got somewhere to be,

so maybe less with the crying

and more with the frying, huh?"

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=294" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="294">00:04:54</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
<action>inhales</action> And the girl apologizes, again,

and she offers me a free churro

with my meal.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=299" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="299">00:04:59</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
And as I'm leaving,

I think, "I just got a free churro

because my mom died."

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=304" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="304">00:05:04</a>

you get a free churro.

When I was a teenager,

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=462" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="462">00:07:42</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
I performed a comedy routine

for my high school talent show.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=466" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="466">00:07:46</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
There was this cool jacket

that I wanted to wear

because it would make me

look like Albert Brooks.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=470" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="470">00:07:50</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
For months, I saved up for this jacket,

but when I finally had enough,

I went to the store and it was gone.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=475" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="475">00:07:55</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
They had just sold it to someone else.

So, I went home and I told my mother.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=478" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="478">00:07:58</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
She said, "Let that be a lesson.

<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=480" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="480">00:08:00</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
She was really good

at dispensing life lessons,

that always seemed to circle back

to everything being my fault.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=488" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="488">00:08:08</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
But then, on the day of the talent show,

my mother had a surprise for me.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=492" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="492">00:08:12</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Even though she didn't know how to say it,

I knew this meant that she loved me.

And in TV, flawed characters

"Hey, um, you know that episode

after Ethan finds out his crush

only asked him to the dance

In all the shots of the horse,

you can see a paper coffee cup

on the kitchen counter,

the coffee cup's missing.

was making a statement,

about the fluctuant subjectivity of memory

writing this book,

I watched the entire run of it,

hoping that it would get better,

and it never did.

It had all the right pieces, but it just--

It couldn't put them together.

I was really bummed out,

not because I liked the show,

but because I knew it could be

so much better,

And that's what losing a parent is like.

Suddenly, you realize you'll never have

the good relationship you wanted,

and as long as they were alive,

It's good to know
