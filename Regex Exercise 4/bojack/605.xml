I'm talking the sexiest guys of the '90s:

Nick Nolte. Mickey Rourke...

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Literally, here we are in the '90s,

and these are the guys

we think are sexy, right?

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Angela Diaz,

head of the network, calls me,

working schmuck, Danny Bananas,

and says, "Danny, Herb Kazzaz is leavin',

and I want you to run <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

</speech>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
So, here's me, thinking,

"What an opportunity

to write for the most finely-calibrated

ensemble cast on television!"

<speech speaker="Speaker">
-Uh.

-I know it's no secret

that you and Herb had some friction,

and he left the show

under not-great circumstances.

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Now I'm coming at this from a place of...

this is your house,

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026963?t=60" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="60">00:01:00</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
The magic of <i>Horsin' Around</i>

is not Herb Kazzaz or Danny Bananas.

</speech>
