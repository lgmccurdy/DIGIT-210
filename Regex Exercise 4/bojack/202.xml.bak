So, at the end of the day,

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=12" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="12">00:00:12</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
I'm just a regular guy trying

to live a regular life.

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Remember that time you peed

in Drew Barrymore's car?

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=18" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="18">00:00:18</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Uh, yes, I remember that.

Why do you remember that?

</speech>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
It was in your book.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=23" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="23">00:00:23</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
-You should do that to someone here.

-What? No.

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Well, anyway, I can't believe

I'm on a date with BoJack Horseman.

<speech speaker="Speaker">
I feel like that anonymous girl

from Chapter 8 of your book

mixed with the pluck and determination

of that anonymous girl

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=36" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="36">00:00:36</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
-from Chapter 12.

-We don't need to dwell on the past.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=39" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="39">00:00:39</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Wait, shut up.

Is this the restaurant you bought

when you were trying

to show up Mr. Peanutbutter?

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=44" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="44">00:00:44</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
-Uh... No.

-Hey, this table's a little wobbly.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=47" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="47">00:00:47</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Want to yell at the waiter

and make a scene?

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=49" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="49">00:00:49</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
-No, I don't need--

-Come on, do that BoJack thing

where you make a big deal

and everyone laughs,

but at the same time we relate,

because you're saying

the things polite society won't.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=58" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="58">00:00:58</a>

This table's been wobbling all evening.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=65" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="65">00:01:05</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
If I wanted to flop around and get seasick

for an hour, I'd call your mother.

<speech speaker="Speaker">
-Something in that area or...?

-Take me home now

and don't let me get out of bed

until I turn horse-colored.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=76" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="76">00:01:16</a>

<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=79" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="79">00:01:19</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
No, I wanted you to leave more quietly.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=81" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="81">00:01:21</a>

Some of us here are trying

to forget you exist.

</speech>

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=155" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="155">00:02:35</a>

{\an8}I wanted to be responsible last night,

so I Ubered home

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=161" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="161">00:02:41</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
I gotta get ready for my grand opening.

It's finally happening. My Disneyland.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=166" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="166">00:02:46</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}I realize that by saying "what"

I might set off a chain of events

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=169" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="169">00:02:49</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}whereby we continue this conversation,

but what?

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=172" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="172">00:02:52</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}Well, remember when I first moved in

and I kept asking

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=175" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="175">00:02:55</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}-if we could go to Disneyland?

-I do not.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=177" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="177">00:02:57</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}And then you said

that there was no Disneyland.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=179" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="179">00:02:59</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}-No.

-That Disneyland was a made-up lie,

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=182" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="182">00:03:02</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}like the tooth fairy, that parents use

to get their kids to behave.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=186" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="186">00:03:06</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}-Oh, yeah, that shut you up.

-Sure did.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=188" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="188">00:03:08</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}But then I thought,

why isn't there a Disneyland?

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=192" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="192">00:03:12</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}People would love it!

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=193" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="193">00:03:13</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}So, I took matters into my own hands,

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=196" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="196">00:03:16</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}and over the last five years,

I built my own Disneyland.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=199" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="199">00:03:19</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}You've been doing this for five years?

How have you never mentioned it?

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=203" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="203">00:03:23</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}I bought that cheap plot of non-arable

dirt by the toxic waste dump

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=207" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="207">00:03:27</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}-up the hill from the old fire station.

-Okay, Todd.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=210" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="210">00:03:30</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}-I'm gonna build a Disneyland.

-Sounds great, champ.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=213" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="213">00:03:33</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}If it wasn't for that,

she never would've gotten sober.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=216" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="216">00:03:36</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}Just finished drawing up blueprints

for that Disneyland I'm building.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=219" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="219">00:03:39</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}Kind of busy here, Todd.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=221" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="221">00:03:41</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}So, it turned out to be a good thing

I peed in her car.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=223" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="223">00:03:43</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}Sorry for all the noise.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=225" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="225">00:03:45</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}Got this crew of worker bees

to help me build my Disneyland.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=229" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="229">00:03:49</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}Okay, I get it. You are building

your own Disneyland.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=233" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="233">00:03:53</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}-Literally the first I'm hearing of this.

-Anyway, tomorrow we open the gates.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=237" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="237">00:03:57</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}Finally, people will have a place to go

after they win the Super Bowl.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=242" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="242">00:04:02</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}But you do know

that there already is a Disneyland?

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=244" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="244">00:04:04</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}-Yeah, I built it.

-No, I mean the real Disneyland.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=247" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="247">00:04:07</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}You mean, the one in the hearts

and minds of children everywhere?

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=250" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="250">00:04:10</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}-The one in Anaheim!

-I think we're saying the same thing.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=253" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="253">00:04:13</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=257" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="257">00:04:17</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Well, I think it's safe

to take the cone off.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=260" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="260">00:04:20</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
I can do it for a small co-pay.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=263" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="263">00:04:23</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Can't say I'll miss it,

but we did have some crazy adventures

together these last few weeks.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=270" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="270">00:04:30</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Honey, would you rub my chin for me

so I can remember things?

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80048077?t=274" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="274">00:04:34</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
It's not an operation,

but we could go to Storky's again.
