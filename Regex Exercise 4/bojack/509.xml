So, ever since<i> Philbert </i>wrapped

earlier today,

the question on everybody's mind is,

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200250?t=268" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="268">00:04:28</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
You're a serious actor now,

so I guess, narrate a documentary

about global warming,

and then take a private jet

to the premiere?

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200250?t=278" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="278">00:04:38</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Seems like everything's based

on books these days,

so I went to the book store

to scout some material.

<speech speaker="Speaker">
I'll just wait 'til the movie comes out,

then see the movie,

and decide if the book the movie

is based on would make a good movie.
