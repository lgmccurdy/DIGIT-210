I think that's why her death

was so scary for me,

why I didn't wanna confront it,

<speech speaker="Speaker">
The first time Sarah Lynn ever got drunk,

she was a child, and it was vodka, right?

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=911" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="911">00:15:11</a>

Doctor Champ,

thank you for returning my call.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=925" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="925">00:15:25</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
I didn't wanna say anything,

but just watching BoJack

in that interview,

talking like he's a victim in all this.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=931" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="931">00:15:31</a>

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=934" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="934">00:15:34</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
I understand as a therapist,

you're not at liberty to divulge

what your client told you in confidence.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=939" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="939">00:15:39</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
But I'm not a therapist.

I'm a therapy horse.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=942" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="942">00:15:42</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=944" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="944">00:15:44</a>

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=945" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="945">00:15:45</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Because Sharona was a drunk, too,

so you can't trust a thing she says.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=948" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="948">00:15:48</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Obviously, she has a vendetta against me.

Besides, I already apologized to her.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=952" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="952">00:15:52</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=954" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="954">00:15:54</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Okay, when you put it all together,

it looks bad.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=956" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="956">00:15:56</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Do you see any connection between

those other women and Sarah Lynn?

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=959" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="959">00:15:59</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
There's no connection between anyone,

that's what I keep saying!

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=962" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="962">00:16:02</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Sarah Lynn wasn't like those other girls.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=965" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="965">00:16:05</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
I loved Sarah Lynn.

She was like a daughter to me.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=968" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="968">00:16:08</a>

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=972" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="972">00:16:12</a>

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=974" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="974">00:16:14</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
It's not like I got Sarah Lynn drunk

for the purpose

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=977" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="977">00:16:17</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">

<speech speaker="Speaker">
-Did you say you had sex with her?

-That was later. She was an adult.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=985" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="985">00:16:25</a>

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=990" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="990">00:16:30</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">

and the thing about addicts--

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=992" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="992">00:16:32</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=995" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="995">00:16:35</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
I took her to rehab, by the way!

I tried to get her help.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=998" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="998">00:16:38</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
I just keep thinking

about those 17 minutes.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=1000" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1000">00:16:40</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=1004" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1004">00:16:44</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
But she wasn't actually dead yet.

She died in the hospital.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=1007" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1007">00:16:47</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
-Right, but at the time, I didn't...

-Ever wonder what would've happened

if you didn't take those 17 minutes?

Do you think she might still--

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=1013" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1013">00:16:53</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
No! I... Look, obviously

when I did all that stuff, I wasn't--

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=1015" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1015">00:16:55</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
So to recap, you gave Sarah Lynn alcohol

when she was a child.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=1019" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1019">00:16:59</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
She then became an addict.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=1021" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1021">00:17:01</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Come on, there was a lot of stuff

in between--

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=1022" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1022">00:17:02</a>

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=1025" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1025">00:17:05</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
When she was intoxicated,

you had sex with her,

and when she was sober,

you gave her the heroin that killed her.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=1030" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1030">00:17:10</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Then in an effort to cover for yourself,

you waited to call the paramedics

that might have saved her life.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=1037" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1037">00:17:17</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">

you have any power over women.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=1044" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1044">00:17:24</a>

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=1046" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1046">00:17:26</a>

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=1048" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1048">00:17:28</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
This is just a ratings win she can use

as leverage for her next big paycheck.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=1051" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1051">00:17:31</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
I think people are gonna see

that she was just out to get me.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026970?t=1055" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1055">00:17:35</a>
