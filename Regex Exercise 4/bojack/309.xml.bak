<speech speaker="Speaker">
BoJack! Beautiful day, huh?

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=24" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="24">00:00:24</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Perfect day to go outside,

not read the trades

or talk to anyone in the industry

or watch entertainment television

or have a gut feeling about the ratings

for your television show last night.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=33" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="33">00:00:33</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
- Princess Carolyn, I'm dying.

- You read the trades.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=36" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="36">00:00:36</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
My heart is in my stomach,

my stomach is in my butt,

and my butt ran away with the spoon.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=41" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="41">00:00:41</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
That makes sense

because your butt is quite a dish.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=44" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="44">00:00:44</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Can you come over? I need you.

<speech speaker="Speaker">
What the...?

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=52" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="52">00:00:52</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
I ordered a few feel better pizzas

to feel better. It did not work.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=56" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="56">00:00:56</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Then I sprinkled happy pills on them,

and washed it all down

with a "Please, God, make my pain go away"

vermouth and ice cream float.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=63" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="63">00:01:03</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
- Somehow I feel worse.

- That's a real mystery.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=65" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="65">00:01:05</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
My show was terrible.

Why did I insist on a mockumentary format?

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=69" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="69">00:01:09</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
It's already an overused trope now,

in 2007.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=72" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="72">00:01:12</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Mockumentary is not a trope,

it's a device for storytelling.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=76" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="76">00:01:16</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
And your show is daring and cutting edge.

People just aren't ready.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=79" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="79">00:01:19</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Yeah, people! It's not me.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=82" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="82">00:01:22</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
It's the people that are the problem!

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=84" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="84">00:01:24</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Everyone's dumb and I am great.

Why do I always forget that?

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=87" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="87">00:01:27</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
That's the spirit.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=88" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="88">00:01:28</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
I'm starting to think this show is

the best thing that happened to me.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=91" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="91">00:01:31</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
- Really?

- Yeah.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=92" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="92">00:01:32</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
It made me realize you're the best thing

that happened to me,

with your sexy cat eyes

and your cute little hair curl.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=98" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="98">00:01:38</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
You look like a soft serve

strawberry ice cream.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=102" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="102">00:01:42</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
BoJack, we can't. I'm your agent.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=104" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="104">00:01:44</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
You are so much more than that.

You're my lighthouse, my Garmin.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=108" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="108">00:01:48</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
You're the little plastic table

they put in pizza boxes

to keep the pizza from getting smushed.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=112" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="112">00:01:52</a>

Don't you break my heart,

<speech speaker="Speaker">
- Did you just say something to me?

- No, I was just being wistful, I guess.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=127" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="127">00:02:07</a>

Well, can you be wistful a little quieter?

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=130" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="130">00:02:10</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">

- Okay, BoJack.

</speech>

{\an8}Once you get your Oscar nom,

we'll have our pick. That's the key.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80073225?t=231" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="231">00:03:51</a>

To be honest I am, how you say,

sweating bull's nets.

What can I say? Sometimes I'm too good

It was because I was busy

getting you the <i>Pegasus </i>movie,

which I know you did not get,

but trust me,

you'll see not getting these movies was
