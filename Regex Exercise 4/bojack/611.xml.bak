<speech speaker="Speaker">
True, Max and I shared lodging

to husband our expenditures,

and true, too, we showered together

one night when the tank broke down

and the hot water was scarce,

but other than those mild inconveniences,

the fact-finding mission went as fine

as the print at the bottom

of a contract,

and we're close as ever

to sewing things up.

<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026969?t=151" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="151">00:02:31</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}and we relaunched it with

my fiancée Pickles as a themed eatery.

</speech>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81026969?t=157" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="157">00:02:37</a>

<speech speaker="Speaker">
Pickles wanted small plates,

Joey wanted lazy Susans,

and I wanted the theme to be my face

is on the front of the menu.

<speech speaker="Speaker">
{\an8}Huh? It's the perfect compromise

because everybody got what they wanted,

I know this last story

is taking its sweet time,

but once we can tie down

this Bo-Person Horse-fellow to Sarah Lynn

on the night of her death,

we'll know he procured the final blow,

the blow being not blow but horse,

a scoop in itself,
