It\\'s \\njust like the story of the grasshopper \\nand the octopus. All year long the grasshopper \\nkept burying acorns for winter while \\nthe octopus mooched off his girlfriend \\nand watched TV. But then the winter \\ncame and the grasshopper died and the \\noctopus ate all his acorns and also \\nhe got a racecar. Is any of this getting \\nthrough to you?\\nI\\'ll be whatever I wanna do! That Guy \\nwas the greatest businessman that ever \\nlived and before his mysterious death \\nhe taught me everything he knew.  But \\nsome things I had to learn myself.  \\nI learned that money is fine but in \\nthe end what counts is people... ...People \\nyou love... ...You can\\'t put a price \\non that... So I\\'m giving up control \\nof the company... ...to a man of enourmous \\nexperience... ...Professor... ...Hubert \\nFarnsworth.\\nAww. Poor little guy. You look like \\nyou haven\\'t eaten in a month. Here......but \\nif Mr Panucci asks, your name is Seynour \\nAsses!  I like you Seymour, you\\'re not \\nconstantly judging me like all the other \\ndogs - are you? Nah. We understand each \\nother.  People think you\\'re a dumb mutt \\nwho smells bad, can\\'t find a girlfriend \\nand has a crummy job. But you\\'re keepin\\' \\nit real and call no man \"Mister.\"  Well \\ngoodbye.  Live long and prosper.\\nThat\\'s it! You can only take my money \\nfor so long before you take it all, \\nand I say enough.  I\\'ve got one dollar \\nleft, and this one I\\'m holding onto! \\nOh no you don\\'t!  I may not know much \\nabout horses but I know a lot about \\ndoing anything for one dollar!  If you \\nthink bad luck can defeat me then you \\ndon\\'t know my name is Philip J -\\nMy fellow fish monsters. Far be it for \\nme to question your stupid civilisation \\nor its dumb customs. But is squeezing \\neach others brains out with a giant \\nnutcracker really going to solve anything? \\nDr. Zoidberg is my friend. And though \\na woman has come between us, I say we\\'ll \\nalways remain friends. And you know \\nwhy?  One reason.\\nBigfoot? Is that you? I\\'m not like the \\nothers Bigfoot. I see through your monster \\ncoatings to the gentle loner inside. \\nI bet you have a wounded racoon friend \\nthat you tenderly nurse back to health \\nand go......and in the end they shoot \\nyou. But you teach us about things. \\nOh, it\\'s a flying saucer. \\nThe moon was like this awesome, romantic, \\nmysterious thing, hanging up there in \\nthe sky where you could never reach \\nit, no matter how much you wanted to. \\nBut you\\'re right. Once you\\'re actually \\nhere it\\'s just a big dull rock. I guess \\nI just wanted you to see it through \\nmy eyes, the way I used to.\\nOh.  Thank you. Y\\'know, when I was first \\nasked to make a film about my nephew, \\nProfessor Farnsworth, I thought \"Why \\nshould I?\" Then later Leela made the \\nfilm. But if I had made the film, you \\ncould bet there would have been a lot \\nmore topless women on motorcycles!  \\nRoll film!\\nIn my time, we didn\\'t depend on high-tech \\ngadgets like you do. We didn\\'t need \\na mechanical washing unit to wash our \\nclothes. We just used a washing machine. \\nAnd look: You don\\'t need an electric \\ncan-opener to feed yourself. All you \\nneed is a trusty Swiss Army knife.  \\nOw!  \\nI know I should but I just can\\'t. Remember \\nwhen I had those stomach worms that \\nmade me smart? I could play the holophonor \\nand it made Leela like me.  Hey Bender, \\nas long as you know, I have a holophonor \\nrecital Tuesday and I\\'d really like \\nto have somebody there. Please?\\nI know, and I\\'ve grown to accept that. \\nNow I\\'m more interested in that new \\npizza parlour across the street. Kinda \\nmakes me pine for my days as a pizza \\ndelivery boy. \"Here\\'s you pizza,\" I\\'d \\nsay. \"I didn\\'t order any,\" they\\'d say. \\nAnd then I\\'d be off to my next adventure. Destiny has cheated me by \\nforcing me to decide upon,\\n\\nThe woman that I idolise,\\n\\nOr the hands of an automaton,\\n\\nWithout these hands I can\\'t complete the opera that was captivating \\nher,\\n\\nBut if I keep them,\\n\\nAnd she marries him,\\n\\nThen he probably won\\'t want me dating her.\\n\\n\\nLeela cried for her lost love as Fry \\nlay dead under the heavy bookcase. The \\nBig Brain laughed in triumph......Then, \\nfor no reason, he left Earth forever. \\nThe end.  There!  Now he\\'s trapped in \\na book I wrote: A crummy world of plot \\nholes and spelling errors.\\nYou might as well put that chequebook \\naway, because I\\'ve discovered something \\neven more important. My friends. And \\nthey aren\\'t worth even a penny to me. \\nThat\\'s why these anchovies are going \\non a pizza, so I can share the food \\nI love with the people I like.\\nTrust me on this. While other people \\nwere out living their lives, I wasted \\nmine watching TV, because deep down \\nI knew it might one day help me save \\nthe world. Plus, I would have lost my \\nWorkman\\'s Comp if I hadd gone outside. \\nNow just read these cue cards.\\nNo, it\\'s my fault too. I\\'m sure I threw \\nout more than my share of that trash \\nup there. Also, one month my toilet \\nbroke and it just went straight in the \\ngarbage can.  Leela was right. The people \\nof the 20th century were idiotic slobs. \\nEspecially me.\\nI don\\'t know. This place is great and \\nall but its just so artificial. The \\ngravity, the air, the gophers. You might \\nas well stay on Earth.  That\\'s what \\nI came to see! I wanna go out there \\nand jump around like an astronaut. Screw \\nthis phoney stuff! Every Christmas my mom would \\nget a fresh goose for goose burgers \\nand my dad would whip up his special \\neggnog out of bourbon and ice cubes. \\nThis dumb holiday just makes me think \\nof all the things I left behind. Let\\'s \\njust stop talking about Xmas.\\nI never told anybody this but a thousand \\nyears ago I used to look up at the moon \\nand dream about being an astronaut. \\nI just didn\\'t have the grades. Nor the \\nphysical endurance. Plus I threw up \\na lot and nobody liked spending a week \\nwith me.\\nDear Horse God, I know I don\\'t usually \\npray to you, sometimes I doubt you even \\nexist. But if you\\'re willing to grant \\nme luck, please, stamp your hoof once. \\nCome on number six move it!  Don\\'t \\ndo that! What are you -  Man it\\'s contagious!\\nAnd you made me feel like a jerk for \\ntrusting you. Just like when my friend \\nRichie swore he wasn\\'t taking drugs \\nand then he sold me my mom\\'s VCR and \\nthen later I found out he was taking \\ndrugs. You make me ashamed to be your \\nfriend.\\nThe Ronco Record Vault! Yancy\\'ll never \\nget his hands on you in here or my money \\nback.  Ah The Breakfast Club soundtrack! \\nMan I can\\'t wait til I\\'m old enough \\nto feel ways about stuff!  Stay safe \\nclover. I may need you again someday.\\nPlease. Give me a chance to be romantic \\non my own. I\\'ve got a baggy of massage \\noil, and I\\'m gonna give you my super \\nback rub, just like a I used to give \\nAmy when I was going out with her, and \\nshe always seemed... - Uh-oh!\\nNo! Drugs are for losers and hypnosis \\nis for losers with big, weird eyebrows. \\nI don\\'t know what amazing thing I did \\nyou make you love me but, whatever it \\nwas, we\\'re married now. We\\'ve got the \\nrest of our lives to work -\\nEvery time something good happens to \\nme you say it\\'s some kind of madness, \\nor I\\'m drunk, or I ate too much candy. \\nWell I saw a real mermaid and I wish \\nfor once my friends would have decency \\nand kindness to believe me.\\nWhat are we supposed to do for money? \\nAll I\\'ve got is my frequent taffy eater\\'s \\ncard, my first moustache......and this \\npicture of me and my old girlfriend, \\nMichelle, and that ski instructor she \\nwas just friends with.\\n\\'Cause it-it taught me so much. Like \\nhow you should accept people, whether \\nthey be black, white, Klingon or even \\nfemale. But most importantly, when I \\ndidn\\'t have any friends, it made me \\nfeel like maybe I did.\\nGosh my old neighbourhood!  That\\'s the \\nbench where I found some shirts!  That \\nfire hydrant! In summer we\\'d light it \\non fire! On that corner, some guy with \\na bushy beard handed out a socialist \\nnewsletter!\\nWow Bender. Are you and the ship an \\nitem? I mean I know you\\'re both items \\nbut...how can you date a ship anyway? \\nIt\\'d be like me dating a really fat \\nlady. And living inside her. And she\\'d \\nbe all like...\\nY\\'know, I guess it should be but actually \\nI\\'m glad. I had nothing to live for \\nin my old life. I was broke, I had a \\nhumiliating job and I was beginning \\nto suspect my girlfriend might be cheating \\non me.\\nI\\'m glad you\\'re all here. I wanted to \\nintroduce you to my on-again-off-again \\ngirlfriend of the past thousand years, \\nMichelle.  Michelle, this is Leela. \\nThis is Bender.  The professor.  Hermes \\nand Amy.\\nWell, sure, but not in our dreams. Only \\non TV and radio. And in magazines and \\nmovies and at ball games and on buses \\nand milk cartons and t-shirts and written \\nin the sky. But not in dreams. No siree!\\nAs vice chairman of Planet Express I\\'d \\nlike to say a few words. There comes \\na time for every man who becomes rich \\nand deserts his friends, when he goes \\nback how it was. For me, that time is \\nnow....\\nWait a second! This is Panucci\\'s! I \\nused to work in this exact pizzeria! \\nAnd for your information lady, this \\nwas not just used to paddle my butt, \\nit was also used to move pizzas and \\ncrush rats.\\nWhat\\'s the point of Xmas when everyone \\nyou know died a thousand years ago? \\nI\\'m the lonliest person on Earth.  Hey, \\nLeela, how \\'bout a little sympathy here, \\nhuh?  Yoiks! What was that about?\\nWhat\\'s so wonderful about Leela being \\nnormal? The rest of us aren\\'t normal \\nand that\\'s what makes us great. Like \\nDr. Zoidberg: He\\'s a weird monster who \\nsmells like he eats garbage and does.\\nI hid my seven leaf clover in this very \\nrecord jacket so my brother Yancy wouldn\\'t \\nget it.  Here goes.  It\\'s gone!  the \\nwhole place has been cleaned out! Yancy \\nstole my clover! That thief!\\nI don\\'t get it, Michelle. The last time \\nI saw you, you were doing great. You \\nhad just dumped me and you were well \\non your way to getting you life back \\non track. Why\\'d you freeze yourself?\\nI nominate That Guy. Not just because \\nhe has a suit but because he knows about \\nbusiness and stuff and he has a tie. \\nMy shares still count if they went \\nthrough the washing machine right?\\nHey, don\\'t blame me. You tried to force \\nGuenter to be a human but he\\'s an animal. \\nHe belongs in the wild. Or in the circus \\non one of those tiny tricycles. Now \\nthat\\'s entertainment.\\nHello? Pizza delivery for......Icy Wiener?! \\nAw crud! I always thought at this point \\nin my life I\\'d be the one making the \\ncrank calls!  Here\\'s to another lousy \\nMillenium.  What the?\\nYou\\'re right Professor. We might not \\nbe a traditional family like the Murphy\\'s \\nnext door or the lesbian coven across \\nthe street but we are a family, and \\nThat Guy understands that.\\nWell, a wonderful girl loves me. But \\nI need to know if it\\'s really me she \\nloves, or just what you worms have made \\nof me. That\\'s why with all due respect, \\nI\\'m asking you to leave.\\nOh, right. I was supposed to assign \\nyou a job. Let me just get your career \\nchip installed.  Hold out your palm. \\nWhat are you scared of? It\\'s just like \\ngetting your hand pierced.\\nLeela, there\\'s something I\\'ve wanted \\nto tell you for a long time but every \\ntime I try I get nervous and my mouth \\nfeels like it\\'s stuffed with peanut \\nbutter, even when it\\'s not.\\nI just saw something incredibly cool. \\nA big floating ball that lit up with \\nevery colour of the rainbow, plus some \\nnew ones that were so beautiful I fell \\nto my knees and cried.\\nYes there is Bender. Bender was a lot \\nof things to a lot of people, but looking \\nback, the number one thing I can say \\nabout him is this, and simply this: \\nBender was my friend.\\nLucy Liubot, if I don\\'t survive the \\ncorn I want you to know that I love \\nyou as much as a man can love a computerised \\nimage of gorgeous celebrity. Which it \\nturns out is a lot.\\nHmm, I remember the square dancing stomachs, \\nalthough that might have been a milanta \\ncommerical. Wait! The brains! I do remember! \\nBut no one else does. They said I was \\ncrazy.\\nMost important of all is the big screen \\nTV. Human families need a TV when they\\'re \\neating so they don\\'t have to talk to \\neach other.  Ah, the Earthican pasttime, \\nblernsball!\\n\\'Cause I think Alkazar\\'s hding something. \\nListen Leela, you may not like it, you \\nmay not believe it, you may not wanna \\nhear it but Alkazar\\'s a jerk, he\\'s bad \\nfor you. He -\\nHello? Pizza delivery for......Icy Wiener?! \\nAw, crud! I always thought at this point \\nin my life I\\'d be the one making the \\ncrank calls!  Here\\'s to another lousy \\nmillennium. \\nExcuse me? You can\\'t park here. The \\nparking area\\'s over there.  Wow nice \\ntube!  Hey. Hey what\\'s the big idea? \\nStop abducting me. Why does your vanity \\nplate say \"Probe 1\"?\\nI can\\'t believe this. Bender is supposed \\nto murder his closest friend, which \\nI thought was me. But he went straight \\nfor you. He didn\\'t even try to second-degree \\nmurder me.\\nI\\'m walking on sunshine! Ooo-oo-ooh! \\nI\\'m walking on sunshine! Ooo-oo-ooh! \\nAt a boy Seymour! Right here waiting \\nfor me as always! Just like that huge \\nmushroom in my shower!\\nHey, my girlfriend had one of those! \\nActually it wasn\\'t her\\'s it was her \\ndad\\'s. Actually she wasn\\'t my girlfriend. \\nShe just lived next door and never closed \\nher curtains.\\nLook, Leela, I don\\'t understand this \\nworld but you obviously do, so I give \\nup. If you really think I should be \\na delivery boy, I\\'ll do it.  Your chip. \\nWhat are you doing?\\nNo, Professor, don\\'t give up. There \\nwere plenty of times in my century when \\nI was gonna give up but I never did. \\nNever! Hey, are you even listening to \\nme? Oh, I give up!\\nIt\\'s not filth. It\\'s a glorious monument \\nto the achievements of the 20th century. \\nLook! A real Beanie Baby.  Oh! A Mr. \\nSpock collector\\'s plate!  Some Bart \\nSimpson dolls!\\nHis name was Seymour. He was once intimate \\nwith the leg of a wandering saxaphonist. \\nHe had wet dog smell, even when dry. \\nAnd he was not above chasing the number \\n29 bus.\\nWell, I spent every penny I had but \\nI bet Leela\\'s gonna love you.  Hey, \\nyou\\'re quite the talker, aren\\'t you? \\nShut the hell up!  Ow!  Stupid bird! \\nI know where you live.\\nFor starters, only use quality ingredients. \\nCase in point: No more live bees.  Oregano \\nworks equally well. And when you put \\npizzas in the oven, don\\'t get in with \\nthem.\\nThanks, Leela. From now on, I\\'ll take \\nall the help you\\'re willing to give. \\nI know you just want what\\'s best for \\nme.  Ow! What was that for?  Hey, come \\non!  That hurt!\\nI\\'m doing my job -- there\\'s Amy. I spend \\na few hours selecting a candy from the \\nmachine -- there\\'s Amy. I wake up the \\nmorning after sleeping with Amy -- there\\'s \\nAmy!\\nBut I\\'m not a robot like you. I don\\'t \\nlike having discs crammed into me. Unless \\nthey\\'re Oreos - and then only in the \\nmouth! Don\\'t you understand? I\\'m gonna \\ndie here!\\nI hate the Planet of the Moochers. They \\ntake you out for a drink, but when the \\ncheck comes, their wallet\\'s always in \\ntheir other pants - which they borrowed \\nfrom me!\\nI\\'ve never been able to put into words \\nhow I feel about you. But somewhere \\namong these trillions of hearts, those \\nwords must already exist. And I\\'m gonna \\nfind them.\\nPoor Bender, you\\'re seeing things. You\\'ve \\nbeen drinking too much, or too little, \\nI forget how it works with you. Anyway, \\nyou haven\\'t drunk exactly the right \\namount.\\nHey yeah! Maybe it is still there! Underground \\nin the ruins of Old New York. Helping \\nsome ant defeat another ant or helping \\nsome piece of dirt turn it\\'s luck around.\\nAww, don\\'t cry foreign people. I used \\nto work in a pizzeria and as soon as \\nI stop hallucinating and blasting puke, \\nI\\'m gonna teach you to sell pizza - \\nEarth style!\\nHey, I\\'m starting to get the hang of \\nthis game. The blerns are loaded, the \\ncount\\'s three blerns and two anti-blerns \\nand the infield blern rule is in effect, \\nright?\\nSo it\\'s left, left, right-- Wait! I \\nhave a better idea! I\\'ll go out and \\nget her the perfect Xmas present. Something \\nso great she\\'ll never want to be unhappy \\nagain. You\\'re right. I\\'m never gonna \\nsee him again. I know he was evil and \\non more than one occasion he, he actually \\nstole my blood.  But still, I wish I \\nhad Bender back.\\nThen I\\'ll prove I\\'m alive! By telling \\nyou something only I could know. There\\'s \\na surprise for you in my locker. I got \\nit at a Swedish novelty shop before \\nwe left.\\nOh, it\\'s Bender\\'s apartment. He put \\nin carpeting yesterday so now my head \\nhits the ceiling. Hey, do you realise \\nyou\\'re standing at a weird angle?  Now \\nyou\\'re OK.\\nWhat?! That\\'s not fair. I deserve the \\nsame respect any other college dropout \\ngets. By God, I\\'m gonna enroll here \\nat Mars University and drop out all \\nover again!\\nThat\\'s right. And I think you\\'ll find \\nthat a little knowledge is a dangerous \\nthing!  OK, better think of a new plan. \\nCome on, Fry, think!  Thinking...thinking...\\nDearly beloved, we are here today to \\nremember Bender, taken from us in the \\nprime of life, when he was crushed by \\na runaway semi, driven by the Incredible \\nHulk.\\nHmm, finding God, that - that\\'s important, \\nyeah. But you know what might be a treat \\nfor everyone? If you let me use the \\ntelescope to find my lost friend Bender.\\n...who slurped Hudge the Dewy, who enjoyed \\na soup composed principally of Throm \\nthe Chunky, do solemnly swear to rule \\nwith honour and insanity - uh, integrity!\\nBefore we deliver these hearts, I\\'m \\ngonna find the one that sums up my feelings \\nfor you!  \"I Love You.\" Hmm, too conventional. \\n\"You\\'re My Man.\" Ooo so close!\\nEverything was going great. Then all \\nof a sudden, she\\'s talking about hanging \\nout. Hangin out? She\\'s getting way too \\nserious. I\\'m not a one woman man, Leela.\\nI\\'ve been sitting right here. I picked \\nup my life exactly where I left off \\na thousand years ago. Now if you\\'ll \\nexcuse me it\\'s 8 o\\'clock. Time to get \\nbiz-ay!\\nTime to re-educate you duncebags. We\\'ll \\nstart with US presidents.  This is our \\nfirst president, George Washington. \\nLet\\'s review. Who was our first president?\\nWhat is the meaning of this? We\\'ve got \\na delivery people, let\\'s move, let\\'s \\nmove!  Amy? Mission profile?  Interesting, \\ninteresting. Dr Zoidberg, mission bag?\\nListen Morgan, We\\'re through, you\\'re \\nan evil heartless woman and I never \\nwanna see you again. However would you \\nhelp us get Bender back for old times \\nsake?\\nWell if you\\'re going to be Earthicans \\nwe\\'ll have to teach you. How about your \\npizzeria plays a game against Planet \\nExpress? Oh but you\\'ll need nine players. Don\\'t cry, Bender. Nobody really knows what happens in a black hole. It\\'s\\n        possible she\\'s still alive in another dimension somewhere. Right, Professor?\\nLet me ask you something: Has anyone \\never discovered a hole in nothing with \\nmonsters in it?  \\'Cause if I\\'m the first, \\nI want them to call it \"a Fry Hole\".\\nLeela, about the wedding. I don\\'t know \\nwhat I did to make you love me, and \\nI don\\'t think I tricked you into it, \\nbut maybe I did. And if I did, I\\'m sorry.\\nFirst person on Mars?? I should have \\nbeen the first person on Mars! He stole \\nmy clover, he stole my name and he stole \\nmy life!  And now he broke my hand.\\nSure! It\\'s the price of a cheese pizza \\nand a large soda back where I used to \\nwork, Panucci\\'s Pizza.  It\\'s the price \\nof a cheese pizza and a large soda --\\nWhat\\'s this? This is the same toy surprise \\nI got last time!  I can\\'t work under \\nthese conditions. And without me there \\nis no mission. I am the mission!\\nYeah yeah, but I can\\'t pass up a chance \\nto learn the answers to the greatest \\nquestions of all time.  Is it true that \\npost-it stamp glue is made up of -\\nThe important thing is we\\'re all together \\nfor Xmas. And even though I\\'m surrounded \\nby robots and monsters and old people, \\nI\\'ve never felt more at home.\\nIt\\'s that obnoxious monkey. He kept \\nme up all night with his constant thinking. \\nJust thinking and thinking. He\\'s trying \\nto make me look like an idiot.\\nAll this prolonged exposure to radiation \\nis making me thirsty.  Ah, if only there \\nwas some way of knowing which can had \\nthe winning bottle-cap inside.\\nSo none of you has ever had anchovies? \\nOh, man! You don\\'t know what you\\'re \\nmissing. They were all salty and oily \\nand they melted in your mouth and --\\nStand back and watch the master! This \\nSlurm can.  Now it\\'s garbage. These \\npapers.  Garbage. This picture of your \\nwife.  Pure garbage. Now you try it.\\nYeah, but in the year 3000, I had it \\nall. Several friends, a low-paying job, \\na bed in a robot\\'s closet. I envied \\nno man. But you wrecked everything.\\nI\\'m going down there to get my clover \\nback. Now some of the tunnels have metal \\nbars so I\\'ll need someone who\\'s good \\nat bending. Leela how \\'bout you?\\nHe decided not to let go.  I can\\'t believe \\nyou\\'re gone. I won\\'t! If I can\\'t reach \\nyou physically, I\\'ll just have to try \\nsomething desperately crazy!\\nI had Seymour \\'til he was three. That\\'s \\nwhen I knew him and that\\'s when I loved \\nhim.  I\\'ll never forget him. But he \\nforgot me a long long time ago.\\nOf all the parasites I\\'ve had over the \\nyears, these worms are among the - hell! \\nThey are the best! Leela, how can I \\never repay you for saving them?\\nI just wished I could\\'ve showed you \\nguys how great they were. I may be rich \\nbut I still can\\'t buy back all the things \\nI miss from the 20th century.\\'S PHOTO\\nLeela! No!  Listen to me, you don\\'t \\nwant to lie in bed like a vegetable \\nand do nothing the rest of your life. \\nI\\'ve tried it. Bedsores hurt!\\nThis is awesome! We\\'re gonna be like \\npow-pow-pow, and they\\'re gonna be like \\n...  ... and then we\\'ll have pancakes \\nto celebrate and I\\'ll be like...\\nI\\'m so confused. The Bender I liked \\nturn out to be evil and the Bender I \\nhated was good. How can I live my life \\nwhen I can\\'t tell good from evil?\\nThis is an emergency. Amy made Valentine\\'s \\nplans with some goon and I\\'m gonna be \\nstuck there, lonely and miserable. Will \\nyou be my date, please?\\nY\\'know, I\\'m the luckiest guy in the \\nwhole future. I\\'ve been given a second \\nchance and this time I\\'m not going to \\nbe a total loser.  What\\'s that?\\nI know you\\'ve rejected me a lot before \\nbut frankly I wasn\\'t sure we were right \\nfor each other either, but now I am! \\nSo how \\'bout a date tonight?\\nWow! We\\'ve got Manhattan all to ourselves! \\nI can finally do all the crazy stuff \\nI always dreamed of doing!  Howard Stern \\ns overrated!  Uh, oops!\\nMelllvar, you can\\'t let a TV show be \\nyour whole life. You can do anything \\nyou want. Look at Walter Koenig: After \\nStar Trek, he became an actor.\\nAnd then, while they sat helplessly \\naround the campfire ... a demented knife-wielding \\nescaped lunatic libertarian zombie mutant \\nsnuck up and--\\nPst, Leela. you\\'ve got to get me out \\nof here. It\\'s horrible, eating scraps, \\nletting my waste drop wherever it falls \\nlike an animal in the zoo.\\nBut things are different this time. \\nBefore, she was demanding and possessive. \\nBut now she wants me to do stuff and \\nstay with her all the time.\\nThere but for the flip of a coin go \\nwe. So uh Leela, seeing how the universe \\nwasn\\'t destroyed, you wanna catch an \\nape fight? Y\\'know? Together?\\nYou can\\'t give up hope just because \\nit\\'s hopeless. You gotta hope even more \\nand cover your ears and go \"blah blah \\nblah blah blah blah blah!\"  \\nHello? Pizza delivery for ... Icy Wiener?! \\nAw, crud!  Here\\'s to another lousy Millennium! \\nOw!  I should have left you floating \\nin the toilet!\\nSo\\'s a peacock but you don\\'t eat it \\n\\'til it\\'s cooked. This has to be perfect. \\nI want you to hear exactly what I hear \\nwhen I think about you.\\nI\\'m literally angry with rage! Your \\nco-stars may be gone but we can still \\nget those episode tapes back for the \\nwhole world to see. Come on!\\nHey, a fish this fine belongs in a fish \\nnugget-style chunklet. And anyway, it\\'s \\nbigger than anything you\\'ve caught. \\nOw! My small intestine!\\nC\\'mon, Bender! It\\'s up to you to make \\nyour own decisions in life. That\\'s what \\nseparates people and robots from animals...and \\nanimal robots.\\nLeela, we may not have much time left......so \\nlet\\'s spend all of it reminscing about \\nBender. He was like a big computer than \\nran on magic.\\nOf course I\\'ve been up all night! Not \\nbecause of caffine it was insomnia I \\ncouldn\\'t stop thinking about coffee \\nI need a nap.  Coffee time!\\nWell he didn\\'t check out. The ashtray\\'s \\nstill here.  Look, Nibbler\\'s caught \\nthe scent of vodka and motor oil! Go, \\nboy. Follow that stench.\\nThe year 4000 is severely disappointing. \\nI miss the year 3000 when life was simple \\nand brains flew through space and everyone \\nate lasers.\\nBender, if you don\\'t open that can right \\nnow, your fear will own you, and nothing \\nthat can opener could ever do could \\nbe worse than that.\\nPeople of New New York. Take a lesson \\nfrom the 20th century. Stop all this \\npain-in-the-ass recycling and throw \\nyour garbage on the floor.\\nIt\\'s funny Bender. With you sick and \\nLeela blind only I know what really \\nwent on out there. Maybe someday I\\'ll \\ntell you the whole story.\\nOK, I gotta break down that gate, beat \\nup those three guards, steal that chopper \\nand rescue Bender.  Hey, I did it! Wait, \\nthat\\'s not me.\\nNegative, bossy meat creature. I know \\nnow what my primary function is: I am \\na battle-droid. Sworn to protect the \\nweak from crazy robots.\\nIt\\'s that flag from MTV! And Neil Armstrong\\'s \\nfootprint!  Hey! My foot\\'s bigger! Leela, \\nisn\\'t this the greatest thing you\\'ve \\never seen?\\nSure. I\\'m listed in the phone book so \\nonce I reveal my real name to you along \\nwith my home address and a copy of my \\nbirth certificate -\\nI was just working my way towards the \\nmedulla oblongata - control centre of \\nthe heart and lungs. And if I kill myself, \\nyou die with me.\\nIn my whole life this company was the \\nonly place I ever really felt at home. \\nIf being millionaires is more important \\nto you than our...\\nYep.  It was just a matter of knowing \\nthe secret of all TV shows; At the end \\nof the episode, everything\\'s always \\nright back to normal.\\nWell I don\\'t care if it was some dork \\nin a costume. For one brief moment I \\nfelt the heartbeat of creation. And \\nit was one with my own.\\nYou know what I like best about you, \\nUmbriel? You find me fascinating even \\nwhen I\\'m not claiming to be a jewel \\nthief or a lion tamer.\\nI already did! So, Leela, do you wanna \\nbe like us? Or do you wanna be like \\nAdlai with no severe mental or social \\nproblems whatsoever?\\nI couldn\\'t help it. She loved me because \\nof the part of me that\\'s a slob and \\nI loved her because of the part of me \\nthat\\'s desperate.\\nPoor Bender. Without his brain he\\'s \\nbecome all quiet and helpful. We\\'ve \\ngot to go to the Central Bureaucracy \\nand get that disk back!\\nWhat?? Don\\'t ever say or think that \\nagain! Please. Just concentrate on staying \\nalive!  Fire! Look out!  Oh! You almost \\ngot neutered.\\nYeah. If you rule out every guy with \\na lizard tongue or a low I.Q. or an \\nexplosive violent temper, of course \\nyou\\'re gonna be lonely.\\nVoila. The greatest sandcastle ever \\nbuilt. This is the kind of castle King \\nArthur would have lived in -- If he \\nwere a fiddler crab.\\nThat\\'s where I know her from. She\\'s \\nJenny McNeal. She was a character on \\na TV show back in the 20th century, \\nSingle Female Lawyer. Hey, I remember you. I \\nwas gonna vote for you one time. But \\nvoting isn\\'t cool so I stayed home alone \\nand got trashed on Listerine.\\nThe moon? The moon moon? Wow! I\\'m gonna \\nbe a famous hero just like Neil Armstrong \\nand those other brave guys no one ever \\nheard of!\\nHow can you people be so blase? Here \\nyou are in the year 3000 or so, yet \\nyou just sit around like its the boring \\ntime I came from.\\nWho asked you to? I told you a hundred \\ntimes to stop treating me like a baby. \\nNow go. Go gather your nuts you nagging \\ngrasshopper.\\nAww. That\\'s terrible, Leela. But imagine \\nthe look on their faces when you show \\nup with two friends who eat all the \\nhors d\\'oeuvres.\\nLeela\\'s going nuts and I can\\'t save \\nher unless I learn more about her mysterious \\npast. Isn\\'t there anything else you \\ncan tell me?\\nAmy, you know how at first you like \\nchocolate but then you start to get \\ntired of it because it always wants \\nto hang out with you?\\nPsst, Leela. I\\'ve set up a time-proof \\nshelter in the closet. There\\'s only \\nroom for two, and you\\'re the one I wanna \\nshare it with.\\nAww. There there. If it makes you feel \\nany better, his body was vapourised \\nso there\\'s no chance of him coming back \\nas a zombie.\\nWe checked 90,000 cans of Slurm and \\nall we won was this junk.  I never wanna \\nsee another can of Slurm again. Man, \\nam I thirsty.\\nAnd it was great! We got to see craters \\nand rocks and that one incredible rock \\nthat looked like a crater and, and these \\nfellas.\\nWait. Let me. Bender and I have our \\ndisagreements, but we\\'re still friends \\nand I\\'m gonna show him what that means. \\nTo the ship.\\nNo we\\'re not. And as vice chairman, \\nI believe I speak for the entire board \\nwhen I issue this challenge to Mom. \\nLook at my butt!\\nOh, it\\'s hopeless. I did something so \\ngreat that it won Leela\\'s heart and \\nI\\'ll never, ever know what it was. My \\nlife is empty.\\nWhat\\'s so far-fetched about mermaids? \\nI mean, there\\'s all sorts of weird sea \\ncreatures here in the future. Like Dr. \\nZoidberg.\\nWell sir, I spent all of ninth grade \\nstudying them. Except for that day when \\nmy eyeballs started to bleed. And in \\nmy opinion.\\nFine, I\\'ve got a toast. To Captain Bender! \\nHe\\'s the best......at being a big jerk \\nand his big ugly face is as dumb as \\na butt.\\nLeela, we\\'re missing the premiere.  \\nMy only goal in life was to attend a \\nHollywood shindig. Just pay the valet \\nthe two bucks.\\nI \\'unno. But the analysis showed it \\nwas printed on recycled toilet paper. \\nA squeezably soft paper used mainly \\nin the sewers.\\nNo, I did see a mermaid! She was wearing \\na tube top and she had a beautiful scaley \\ntail. And I think she had hair extensions.\\nNo way! I\\'m not letting my best friend \\nget recycled. Not for five cents, not \\nfor five hundred cents! Leela, I\\'ve \\ngot a plan!\\nValentine\\'s Day\\'s coming? Oh, crap! \\nI forgot to get a girlfriend again. \\nWell since neither of us has a date, \\nwhy don\\'t we...\\nYou haven\\'t won yet, Moivin! You didn\\'t \\nexpect us to even go to a museum, much \\nless steal this ancient heat-seeking \\nmissile.\\nI don\\'t need them. Not when I have my \\nantique videos, my bucket of fossilised \\nKFC and 50 million dollars worth of \\nanchovies.\\nI though that if you heard a familiar \\nvoice, it might help keep your mind \\ntogether. But, who knows if it really \\ngot through.\\nHey, hey, cheer up. Not everyone turns \\nout like their parents. I mean, look \\nat me. My folks were honest hardworking \\npeople.\\nMaybe we\\'re all wearing magic rings \\nbut they\\'re invisible rings so we don\\'t \\neven realise it. Also you can\\'t feel \\nthe rings.\\nWell it\\'s not right to make my dead \\npet an exhibit. That\\'s like digging \\nup Lassie and putting her on display \\nin the Louvre.\\nNo, I can\\'t afford them. Being poor \\nsucks. What kind of world is this where \\nthey advertise things not everybody \\ncan afford?\\nWow, I forgot about TV. Living free \\non the road, you realise how much better \\nlife is without it. Well, let\\'s see \\nwhat\\'s on.\\nI meant the sound Bigfoot just made. \\nHe\\'s been sighted a lot in this area \\nrecently. Just last week a blind hiker \\nfelt him!\\nOh, I had a nightmare I was in the year \\n2000 and you guys never existed. I\\'m \\nso glad I\\'m awake now and you\\'re really \\nhere.\\nThat\\'s a hell of a good parrot. Although, \\nI could get 500 lizards for the same \\nprice. Girls like swarms of lizards, \\nright?\\nIf I were registered to vote, I send \\nthese clowns a message by staying home \\non election day and dressing up like \\na clown.\\nThis is nothing. Back in high school \\nI used to drink a hundred cans of cola \\na week. Right up until my third heart \\nattack.\\nWell, what do you suggest? A daring \\ndaylight robbery of Fort Knox on elephant-back? \\nThat\\'s the dumbest thing I ever heard!\\nLook, Leela, even if you heard one talk, \\nthat doesn\\'t mean it\\'s intelligent. \\nI mean, parrots talk and we eat them, \\nright?\\nBender come on. We\\'ve got to get some \\ndirt on Alkazar. Lets go and find out \\nwhat makes the Forbidden Valley so forbidden.\\nHey, yeah! I used to spit at stuff back \\nin the 20th century. Ah, it\\'s cool how \\nwe sort of think exactly alike, and \\njunk.\\nAww. Poor little guy. Let me just take \\na look at - aha!  I won! I\\'m the new \\nchief! I\\'m the tallest and I weigh the \\nmost!\\nLook, Leela. I know there\\'s some perfect, \\namazing thing I can do to make you love \\nme, and when I figure out what it is \\n-\\nShe\\'s so great. I feel like I can almost \\nremember the magical thing I did to \\nmake her love me. But I guess I never \\nwill.\\nUh, Leela, how you gonna meet your folks \\ntomorrow? We\\'ve already scheduled the \\nZookeeper for a 9am foiling at the museum.\\nAll Leela ever wanted to do was help \\nme. But I was to proud, too stupid to \\naccept it.  I wish I had died instead \\nof her.\\nIt\\'s all lies every word of it! He wasn\\'t \\noriginal, he wasn\\'t a Martian, he wasn\\'t \\nPhilip Fry and since when is he a the?\\nJunk? Maybe you can\\'t understand this \\nbut I\\'ve finally found what I need to \\nbe happy, and it\\'s not friends: It\\'s \\nthings.\\nYou gotta get me out of here. I would \\nhave starved to death if not for that \\nsick vending machine robot.  Gimmie! \\nGimmie!\\nHey! You have no right to criticise \\nthe 20th century. We gave the world \\nthe lightbulb, the steamboat and the \\ncotton gin.\\nThat\\'s a stupid animal. You\\'re stupid! \\nI said I want the best one. Now which \\ncosts more? The parrot or the Stink \\nLizard?\\nBut that\\'s not why people watch TV. \\nClever things make people feel stupid, \\nand unexpected things make them feel \\nscared.\\nI don\\'t know. I got nervous and started \\nthinking about neck bolts.  Wow! Did \\nyou see that vase break? It was all \\nlike -\\nHey! Thinking hurts him. Maybe I can \\nthink of a way to use that.  Aha! Prepare \\nto be thought at. Leela, give me a topic.\\nGood!  Don\\'t finish that cruller, throw \\nit away  Bender. Drink that beer and \\ndrop the bottle on the ground.  Very \\nnice.\\nSo? I\\'m just as important as him.  It\\'s \\njust that, the kind of importance I \\nhave, it doesn\\'t matter if I...don\\'t \\ndo it.\\nYou see? TV audiences don\\'t want anything \\noriginal. They wanna see the same thing \\nthey\\'ve seen a thousand times before.\\nOoo I have one. I\\'m good at video games \\nand bad at everything else. That\\'s why \\nI wish life were more like a video game.\\nLooks like we\\'re under Park Avenue. \\nOoh, ritzy! Just think: All this was \\nprobably once a charity luncheon for \\nthe Met.\\nBees make honey and jelly? Huh. How \\ncome nothing humans make taste good? \\nHelp! I can\\'t swim in jelly as far \\nas I know!\\nY\\'know, I saw the first 30 seconds of \\nthat episode. If I could make up an \\nending, maybe we could act it out ourselves.\\nHmm. According to this map, the only \\nway out is through ... that pipe.  Don\\'t \\nworry. It gets wider after about a mile.\\nSo, Leela, how about a romantic ride \\nin one of those swan boats? They\\'re \\nkinda dangerous but I finally mastered \\nthem.\\nAmy, you won\\'t believe what happened......it \\nwas so scary that you wouldn\\'t -  I \\nknow but listen it gets even scarier.\\nEh, what\\'s the worst thing that could \\nhappen?  Ugh, it\\'s like there\\'s a party \\nin my mouth and everyone\\'s throwing \\nup!\\nWait a second. I\\'m getting an idea. \\nN-No, false alarm. No. Yeah. No. Yeah. \\nNo. Wait. No. Yeah. Yeah. No ... no. \\nYes!\\nI can\\'t believe it. She\\'s risking her \\nlife for me after the way I treated \\nher. I don\\'t deserve this. I feel terrible.\\nI heard that one time you single-handedly \\ndefeated a horde of rampaging somethings \\nin the something something system.\\nOh my God! They dug up a bag of olestra \\nchips from my time!  There must be layers \\nand layers of old stuff down there.\\nListen, Doc, if you wanna score you \\ngotta fake like you\\'re in love.  Just \\nlook her in the eye, start crying and \\nsay \\nHey! A phone booth! I can call my nephew. \\nWow, a real live robot! Or is that \\nsome kind of cheesy New Year\\'s costume?\\nI\\'ll miss you buddy. You\\'ve been like \\na brother and then a sister to me. And \\nnow you\\'re getting married. I love you.\\nAww, you guys came to watch me make \\nout! That is so sweet.  Wait a minute! \\nIs that the head of who I think it\\'s \\nof?\\nThis is so unfair! I liked you back \\nwhen you were a cyclops! That guy\\'s \\nonly interested now that you have two \\neyes.\\nWell, we missed the premiere and we\\'re \\ngonna die. We might as well enjoy the \\nsights.  Oh my God, Sylvester Stallone!\\nWell, thanks to the internet, I\\'m bored \\nwith sex. Is there a place on the web \\nthat panders to my lust for violence?\\nHe may be some lowlife jerk but I don\\'t \\ntrust him. I think he\\'s hiding something \\nand I\\'m gonna find out what it is.\\nThat\\'s not an astronaut, it\\'s a TV comedian. \\nAnd he was just using space travel as \\na metaphor for beating his wife.\\nThat\\'s what I\\'m trying to tell you. \\nSee -  Why are you all staring at me \\nlike that? Is there something on my \\nface?\\nDon\\'t wave your fancy degrees at me. \\nI recognise all this stuff.  Petrified \\nsausages, Old Mr Patelli, and that\\'s \\n-\\nLook! There\\'s been a terrible mistake. \\nI\\'m a human being. See?  I\\'m all squishy \\nand flabby. Also, I complain a lot.\\nDo we have to? I mean they\\'re monks. \\nI\\'m sure their God will let them out \\nor at least give them more shoes to \\neat.\\nBender, I\\'m alive!  You didn\\'t hurt \\nme at all. But I know you wanted to, \\nand that\\'s what matters.  Here\\'s to \\nyou.\\nI\\'ve only got two fantasies left: Be \\ninvisible in a chocolate factory and \\nbe romantically linked with a celebrity.\\nBut this is Lucy Liu! Perhaps the only \\ngood actress of the 21st century! She\\'s \\nmore than just a piece of software.\\nLeela, your scaredness is being transmitted \\nstraight to Bender. If you care about \\nNibbler, stop caring about him!\\nNot big enough. We need something that \\ncan take out an entire army. Something \\nyou could commit a war crime with--\\nLeela, I want you to know I think the \\nway you moved those stars around was \\nreally wonderful. I got you something.\\nMmm. Mmm! Now this is what I call a \\nthousand years of progress: A Bavarian \\ncreamdog that\\'s also self-microwaving!\\nHey, you guys, the most amazing thing \\nhappened. It\\'s two-for-one Tuesday at \\nKrispy Kreme! Plus there\\'s mermaids.\\nAlright, its Saturday night. I have \\nno date, a two litre bottle of Shasta, \\nand my all Rush mix tape! Let\\'s rock!\\nBack in my day, we didn\\'t have your \\nfancy all-digital weapons but we still \\nmanaged to kill each other just fine.\\nWhatever. The correct answer is: To \\nbe a superhero. We have superpowers \\nand we\\'re Americans. This is our chance.\\nAh, the scent of a rose. Curious how \\nan aromatic chain of hydrocarbons can \\nevoke our deepest emotions.  For you.\\nStinger went right through me and you \\ngot all the poison. My new spleen came \\nfrom a guy who liked to motorcycle.\\nI feel like a rat. Here I am whining \\nlike a pig while all along Leela was \\nlonely as a frog. I could kick myself.\\nWoo yeah! Hit him hit him hit him!  \\nNow this is the high life! Watching \\napes mangle each other near celebrities! Sure I can. I learned how to handle delicate social situations\\n        from a little show called Three\\'s Company.\\nI\\'ve never seen a supernova blow up. \\nBut if it\\'s anything like my old Chevy \\nNova, it\\'ll light up the night sky!\\nOK, we\\'re in the middle of nowhere, \\nwhich is the safest part of nowhere. \\nJust stay put and enjoy this calendar.\\nThen it\\'s a deal. We get one night. \\nI keep my horn as long as you two end \\nup doing the horizontal monster mash.\\nI can\\'t believe we flew halfway across \\nthe galaxy and enjoyed a steam just \\nto get lunch for that stupid animal!\\nMan, that\\'s dog\\'s gonna be hard to beat. \\nLook at him bring in the sheep! One \\nsheep, two sheep......three sheep.\\nWell, usually on the show someone would \\ncome up with a complicated plan then \\nexplain it with a simple analogy.\\nMan, I thought Ultimate Robot Fighting \\nwas real, like pro wrestling. But it \\nturns out it\\'s fixed, like boxing.\\nUh, \"video game\" you say? Well golly \\ngee, you mighty spacemen of the future \\nwill have to show me how it works.\\nSeems to be. My neck\\'s just a little \\ntender.  Ow! Cool!  Ow! Listen, Leela. \\nThanks for rescuing me last night.\\nYeah. But I don\\'t guess anything I could \\ndo will ever make you feel the same \\nway about me that I do about you.\\nNo fair. Leela was training me to be \\ncaptain. She even let me sit in her \\nlap and steer - in this comic I drew.\\nSo, Chrissy, we seem to be hitting it \\noff. If you\\'re not doing anything later \\nmight I escort you to a kegger?\\nWow! There\\'s a million aliens. I\\'ve \\nnever seen anything so mind blowing. \\nOoh, a reception table with muffins!\\nWhy exactly did you shave your legs \\nanyway? Are you expecting something \\nto happen with your Valentine\\'s date?\\nCome on freedom cage! Roll me to safety! \\nYes! I never thought I\\'d escape with \\nmy doodle, but I pulled it out!\\nUh, yeah. We\\'ll have one with everything \\nbut anchovies and one with my all time \\nfavourite topping, anchovies!\\nThat\\'s it! This place is too dangerous. \\nWe\\'ve gotta get you out of here!  Everything\\'s \\ngonna be alright Dad!\\nHey, tell me something: You\\'ve got all \\nthis money, how come you always dress \\nlike you\\'re doing your laundry?\\nThen I have no choice but to do something \\nso pitiful and embarrassing that I\\'m \\nashamed to tell you about it.\\nWow! A superpowers drug you can just \\nrub into your skin? You\\'d think it\\'d \\nbe something you have to freebase.\\nPah. I\\'d have won a lot of money too \\nif I still had my lucky seven leaf clover. \\nPlus I\\'d still have my hair.\\nWait! I remember this place. They shut \\nit down after all those people caught \\nsalmonella from the flume ride.\\nThey\\'re scared of our raw power. Oh \\nbut if you want a job, I could beg everyone \\nat the company where I work.\\nSo that\\'s my story Father Changstein \\nel Gamahl. Is there anything religion \\ncan do to help me find my friend?\\nAre you still mad at me for wrecking \\nyour once in a lifetime chance to learn \\nthe meaning of your existence?\\nMy God! It\\'s the future. My parents, \\nmy co-workers, my girlfriend. I\\'ll never \\nsee any of them again. Yahoo!\\nThat\\'s it. I\\'ve had it with women. From \\nnow on, I\\'m concentrating on my career. \\nCan I have my old job back?\\nHi Leela! I\\'m just gonna keep talking, \\neven if you can\\'t hear me. Blah blah \\nblah, blah blah blah blah blah. Look! It\\'s our nebula. Whenever I see it I\\'ll think back to that moment when\\n        we almost-- Never mind!\\nOh, poor Bender. He must be so lonely \\nright now. Trapped a thousand years \\nin the past. Hey! Wait a second!\\nWell, you guys might both be losers \\nbut I just made out with that radiator \\nwoman from the radiator planet.\\nThen she wants me as a trophy husband. \\nLeela, you gotta come to Europa with \\nus, I can\\'t be alone with her.\\nWhoa, whoa, girl. I thought you were \\ntalking about one of those motels where \\nthe bed is shaped like stuff.\\nYou gotta tell me. You\\'re not actually \\nattracted to Calculon right? And if \\nyou are don\\'t tell me. Are you?\\nI\\'d prefer someone from the era of shaved \\nunderarms. Do you have anything with \\na more Lucy Liu feel to it?\\nBut you\\'re better than normal, you\\'re \\nabnormal. If you ask me, you shouldn\\'t \\ncare what other people think.\\nThink about it. Seymour lived a full \\nlife after I was gone. He probably added \\nnew songs to his repertoire. Thirty days hath September, \\nApril, June and ... wonder ... is that \\npeanut butter ... what am I gonna do? \\n\\nRelax, mammal. My robotic software shall \\nmeet your calculatory needs.  What is \\nthe meaning of this symbol?\\nIt really puts things in perspective. \\nI mean, from up here an entire world \\ncan seem utterly insignificant.\\nNo thanks. I just came to tell you that \\nZoidberg\\'s really great. He\\'s got male \\njelly coming out the wazoo.\\nI just wanted to do something to make \\nyou happy. I mean, I miss my family \\nbut you never even had a family.\\nAw c\\'mon, you guys have forever to look \\nfor God. All I\\'m asking is one measley \\nlifetime to find my friend.\\nBender, wait! This is our chance to \\nescape, before Melllvar comes back. \\nBut we all need to work together. Why couldn\\'t she be the other \\ntype of mermaid, with the fish part \\non top and the lady part on the bottom?\\nThat\\'s it! I\\'m getting a hundred cups \\nof coffee! Starting now.  Coffee machine, \\none cup of coffee please.\\nI\\'m never going to get used to the 31st \\ncentury.  Caffinated bacon? Baconated \\ngrapefruit? Admiral Crunch?\\nSir, if I may, why don\\'t you set up \\nlike a billion video cameras in the \\nwoods and see if he walks by one.\\nIt could be my beautiful soul sitting \\nnaked on her couch if I could just learn \\nto play this stupid thing.\\nYes. But it\\'s only recently I\\'ve been \\nable to articulate my thoughts. I love \\nyou Leela and I always have.\\nMaybe that planet over there has a \\ndrive-thru. A Burger Jerk or a Fishy \\nJoe\\'s or a Chizzler or something.\\nI don\\'t know, I don\\'t know. Just say \\nanything. As long as it\\'s compelling, \\nmesmerising, a tour de force.\\nI\\'m telling you, Leela was cool, she \\nwas in command, and when she kicked \\npeople it hurt. It really hurt.\\nHm, Spider, Hubble, Nitrogum...ooh, \\nBig Pink! It\\'s the only gum with the \\nbreath-freshening power of ham.\\nI\\'m capable of making my own decisions, \\nLeela. Did you ever stop to think I \\nmight be happier with gills?\\nOh, alright. How \\'bout this? What if \\nI never fell into that freezer-doodle \\nand came to the future-jiggy?\\nMr. Nimoy, I came as soon as I heard \\nwhat happened centuries ago. I can\\'t \\nbelieve your show was banned.\\nThat jeep\\'s gonna hit him! And I won\\'t \\nexist anymore!  Are you crazy? You almost \\ngot yourself run over!\\nHey, I was frozen. I think I know what \\npeople wanna hear when they first wake \\nup.  Bathroom\\'s that way.\\nYou mean you flipped the coin too? And \\nit was tails? So that\\'s why you said \\nyou had to meet that ghost.\\nThere\\'s a lot about my face you don\\'t \\nknow. Perhaps you and it could get better \\nacquainted over dinner.\\nBrothers and sisters, get your love \\nbeads. Can\\'t journey to the centre of \\nyour mind without love beads!\\nYou know the worst thing about being \\na slave? They make you work but they \\ndon\\'t pay you or let you go.\\nThen today\\'s your lucky day because \\nI happen to be a holding, stroking, \\nlovin\\' machine! Also spankin\\'!\\nYeah. If she had let us use the back-up \\ndolly, we could have broken it, given \\nup and gone home by now.\\nOh!  That\\'s how I must have done it! \\nI moved the stars themselves to write \\nher a love note in the sky.\\nSo that\\'s where those skin flakes went. \\nHmm, do you think this fruit tree\\'s \\ngoing to get enough light?\\nI sure do! That\\'s the real robber and \\nI\\'ll never forget his name as long as \\nI live. And that name is--\\nHey, I have an idea. Who wants to cram \\nin my van and follow Bender on tour \\nand live there, in the van?\\nWould you cram a sock in it Bender? \\nThose aren\\'t even medals! They\\'re bottlecaps \\nand pepperoni slices.\\nI didn\\'t come here to see any activity \\ninvolving two guys. Where do you people \\ndo your erotic display?\\nBelieve it or not, I have more important \\nthings to do today than laugh and clap \\nmy hands.  Reschedule.\\nSir, I\\'m outfitting an expedition to \\na monestary high in the Himalayas. I\\'ll \\nneed a long sleeved coat.\\nThat telescope is as much mine as it \\nis anybody\\'s. I\\'m using it whether you \\ngive me permission or not.\\nI\\'ve been there. My folks were always \\non me to groom myself and wear underpants. \\nWhat am I, the Pope?\\nWho cares what you\\'re programmed for. \\nIf someone programmed you to jump off \\na bridge would you do it?\\nI learned how to work the gravity pump \\ntoo. In case we need to move more stars. \\nSo are we dating now?\\nAnd then, and then, this giant tapeworm \\ntried to play us for chumps but we like \\ntotally dissed Moose!\\nRight! I, Fry, who drank Bont the Viscous, \\nwho drank Ungo the Moist, who guzzled \\nZorn the Stagnant... Thanks, everybody. I love you \\nall. You guys are true -- ow! Cut it \\nout, Bender! That\\'s a tender area!\\nBut I wouldn\\'t even know what to write \\nabout. Unless...  OK I\\'ll do it. If \\nI can make it about Leela.\\nIt\\'s called a van, and in light of the \\nfact that it\\'s not a-rockin\\', I invite \\nyou to come a-knockin\\'!\\nBender, I don\\'t claim to understand \\n\"the biz\" but wouldn\\'t being able to \\nmove help your music career?\\nI shouldn\\'t be here. I shouldn\\'t even \\nexist. But I do which proves...you can\\'t \\nreally be my grandm -\\nThis is awesome! Are we gonna fly through \\nspace fighting monsters and teaching \\nalien women to lurve?\\nJeez, will you lay off! I was delivering \\nthings before you were born! I think \\nI know what I\\'m doing.\\nYou don\\'t have to beat around the bush, \\nLeela, we all know who you\\'re talking \\nabout...uh, me, right?\\nThis is Fry. If you\\'re calling about \\nthe used towels for sale, they\\'re still \\navailable for $45 each.\\nLeela we got lucky this time but you \\nshould be more careful. I don\\'t want \\nanything to happen to you.\\nUh, I\\'m flattered, really. If I was \\ngonna do it with a big, freaky mud bug \\nyou\\'d be way up the list!\\nI never thought it would end this way: \\nGunned down by Santa Claus. Honestly, \\nI didn\\'t see it coming!\\nHey, uh, Guenter? Why don\\'t you get \\nup on the chandelier with your parents \\nand I\\'ll take a picture?\\nOK, my best friend\\'s life is at stake. \\nI can finally prove that I\\'m not a coward. \\nWill you push me?\\nThat clover helped my ratfink brother \\nsteal my dream of going into space. \\nNow I\\'ll never get there.\\nSure! It\\'s the price of a cheese pizza \\nand a large soda back where I used to \\nwork, Panucci\\'s Pizza.\\nWait a minute, Bender is my best friend. \\nWe can\\'t just dump him in the gutter \\nlike Grandma\\'s ashes.\\nI\\'m nobody. There are guys in the background \\nwith Mary Worth comics who are more \\nimportant than me. I\\'m not going out with Amy. It\\'s just to fool her parents. Hey, you\\'re not\\n        jealous, are you?\\nToo bad he wasn\\'t an alligator. Y\\'know, \\nwhen you flush those things they stay \\nalive in the sewers.\\nSo, uh, thanks for the ride, Amy. And \\nI hope there are no hard feelings about \\nyour date, or stuff.\\nThen when I feel so stuffed I can\\'t \\neat anymore, I just use the restroom, \\nand then I can eat more.\\nWell, you were gonna live in the closet \\nanyway. Won\\'t you be just as happy back \\nin your old place?\\nI can\\'t believe Leela and Amy aren\\'t \\nback yet from their half-date. I\\'m gonna \\ncall the restaurant.\\nHey jumbo! How would you like it if \\nLeela said you were sexy and she wanted \\nto make love with you?\\nOh Leela. I feel terrible. If there\\'s \\nanything I can ever do -  Gotcha!  I \\nwon! I\\'m the greatest!\\nLeela, I think you\\'re missing the big \\npicture. When you were a kid what was \\nyour biggest fantasy?\\nWell Bender, I hope this has taught \\nyou a lesson about changing your sex \\nto win five gold medals.\\nHow could you, Leela? I thought you \\nhad some standards. I mean, jeez, he\\'s \\na dumb, gross gorilla! Bio-units, terminate \\nnoise exchange. It is time for you to \\ningest sandwiches from my compartment.\\nWow! You got that off the Internet? \\nIn my day the Internet was only used \\nto download pornography.\\'S PHOTO\\nI don\\'t know if you can hear me Leela \\nbut there\\'s something I wanna tell you. \\nI love you.\\nHuh. Did everything just taste purple \\nfor a second? Oh well. Let\\'s go home \\nyou dumb poop machine.\\nI don\\'t mean to nitpick, super-doc, \\nbut do you think maybe you could take \\none more whack at this?\\nYou\\'re the last store open. I need something \\nfor my friend Leela.  Just give me your \\nbest animal.\\nI had no idea the company would be sold. \\nI was just an innocent suck up. You\\'ve \\ngotta believe me!\\nI hear that. I spent most of my teen \\nyears loving my body. Course, it was \\ntough love but -- ooh!\\nUh-oh. Is this gonna be another crazy \\nexperiment that crosses a line Man was \\nnot meant to cross?\\nLooks like Bender learned an important \\nlesson about respecting other people\\'s \\nfeelings afterall.\\nJust out of curiosity, we could use \\nthe cards to buy gum, then immediately \\nquit the army, right?\\nI can\\'t watch this \\'cause it\\'s creepy \\nand wrong and sick. However I will watch \\nout of curiosity.\\nThis is all my fault. I let my best \\nfriend risk his life just to get my \\ndead dog back.  Bender!!\\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, wait, Bender. So long \\nas we\\'re here why don\\'t we take in some, \\nexotic dancing!\\nWow, it\\'s too bad you can\\'t see Leela \\n\\'cause theres a cool ship out there \\nshooting at somebody.\\nFine. I\\'ll let go and swim around in \\nthe Slurm and drink as much as I want. \\nHelp! I can\\'t swim!\\nNow that you mention it, I do have trouble \\nbreathing underwater sometimes. I\\'ll \\ntake the gills.\\n3000? Yes! I\\'m still in the future! \\nLife is wonderful!  Wait! What are you \\ndoing with my stuff?\\nNo, it can\\'t, but it\\'s got a driver\\'s-side \\nfloor and an 8-track player with genuine \\nmono sound.\\nYup, I remember. They came in last at \\nthe Olympics then retired to promote \\nalcoholic beverages. I guess that just leaves you and your fake fianc� ... all alone ... on a\\n        romatic cruise.\\nI had no choice. I was about to not \\nexist. I could feel myself fading away, \\nlike Greg Kinnear.\\nAnd the people are all phoneys. No one \\nreads. Everything has cilantro on it \\n-  Michelle, baby!\\nSo who should I root for? America or \\none of those countries I learned about \\nat the Food Court?\\nMan, Leela\\'s been gone a long time. \\nI hope she\\'s at least making progress \\nwith Zapp Brannigan.\\nWow! An old-fashioned mosh pit! Come \\non guys. Tonight we\\'re gonna party like \\nits 1999...again.\\nAh, I dunno. That\\'s a chick show. I \\nprefer programmes of the genre \"world\\'s \\nblankiest blank\".\\nWait, Mount Rushmore and the Leaning \\nTower of Pisa? I didn\\'t know they were \\nboth in New York!\\nHey, and while we\\'re on the base I\\'ll \\nvisit my grandfather Enos! He was stationed \\nat Roswell.\\nNope.  No one in New York drove. There \\nwas too much traffic.  Nice! Listen \\nto that baby purr!\\nI tell you, that Butch runs a pretty \\ngood civilisation. I think I\\'ll enjoy \\nserving under him.\\nI\\'m no good at being a slave. I\\'m thinking \\nabout graduate school. Y\\'know? To become \\na barber?\\nBlech! We have to track down my nose \\nbefore some alien snarfs it and does \\nthe worm. Who\\'s in?\\nYes. And I have a message for you from \\nColonel Mitumba! He says this......is \\nfrom Congo Jack.\\nAww, this isn\\'t right. Listen, Bender, \\nif we found your antenna could they \\nstill reattach it?\\nI did. I think. It was probably about \\n50/50. But that\\'s how I really felt \\nabout you, I swear!\\nWell I\\'m gonna take action. It\\'s time \\nto check on my retirement fund.  Damn! \\nStill only $100.\\nOh, good, a physical! Once they examine \\nmy fragile, naked, pink body, they\\'ll \\nsee I\\'m not a--\\nI don\\'t think so. \\'Cause as vice chairman \\nof the company I gain voting control \\nof his shares.\\nBender? No! He\\'s an old fashioned one \\nspaceship robot. Look I\\'ll tell him \\nyou stopped by OK?\\nWhoa whoa, you mean Bender is the evil \\nBender? I am shocked, shocked! Well \\nnot that shocked.\\nOh, hello sir. It\\'s a lovely evening \\nyou have tonight. Um I\\'m here to pick \\nup your daughter.\\nIt\\'s hopeless. I can hear all this great \\nmusic in my head but my stupid hands \\ncan\\'t keep up.\\nWhoa! They discovered an intact, 20th \\nCentury pizzeria! Just like the one \\nI used to work at!\\nBender, if this is some kind of scam, \\nI don\\'t get it. You already have my \\npower of attorney.\\nAlright, bird, you thought you could \\nbeat me in a game of wits. But you just \\nmet your equal.\\nBut, but...Bender need brain...for...smart \\nmaking!  What did you do now? Stop doing \\nthings! Um, let me think. Come and knock on our door, nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh. Uh, Mr\\n        Roper--\\nIs it this room that\\'s making you sad? \\nIt\\'s probably the room. Come on, lets \\ngo for a walk.\\nWhoa! Letters like \"U\" and \"R\" can mean \\nwords like \"You\" and \"Are.\" Here Leela, \\nU-R-2 Cute!\\nWow, I must say I\\'m impressed. You look \\njust like a ball player. Can I pat you \\non the butt?\\n...My whole world is gone. You can\\'t \\npossibly understand what it feels like \\nto be so alone.\\nOf course I do! Bigfoot\\'s my hero. Growing \\nup, he was the celebrity I most identified \\nwith.\\nYeah. But now its the distant future. \\nWhy aren\\'t we out doing everything I \\never dreamed of?\\nThat jerk! No one hoots at my captain \\nunless they\\'re prepared to take it to \\nthe next level!\\nWe can definitely escape, Bender. All \\nyou have to do is bend the hatch off \\nthis steam pipe. Yeah, it\\'s pretty romantic-- Uh, I mean platonic. Th-That sure is one platonic\\n        view!\\nLeela, I just want you to know that \\neven though you\\'re mean, you\\'re the \\nbest captain ever. I\\'m sorry, Leela, I can\\'t \\ngo on any further. Just leave me to \\ndie in that barn over there.\\nYet the Zookeeper escaped. Thus proving \\nthat the deadliest animal of all is \\nthe Zookeeper!\\nI wish they\\'d just wipe out humanity \\nand get it over with. It\\'s the waiting \\nI can\\'t stand. It\\'s my invention, we do it \\nmy way! Now all we need is something \\nto pull it and we\\'re set!\\nNothing is impossible. You\\'d know that \\nif you really took after the Professor, \\nlike I do.\\nIt\\'s moving too fast. Oh I could never \\nget the last one. My brother always \\ngot it for me!\\nIt\\'s not fair. In my day Xmas was supposed \\nto bring people together, not blow them \\napart!\\nThat\\'s the same reason they kept me \\nout of school. So, no one even cared \\nthat I was gone?\\nAll right! Hey. Wait a minute! This \\nis your home planet? We\\'re the evil, \\ninvading aliens?\\nObviously you\\'ve never been in love! \\nOw!  Ow!  Ow!  Now, the hand-eye co-ordination \\nlobe.\\nWhy do you always have to steal everything \\nfrom me Yancy? Find your own life and \\nlive it.\\nThis is it! My Ronco Record Vault!  \\nI still remember the combination.  Three. \\nIt\\'s stuck.\\nIt\\'s my brother Yancy! And there in \\nhis lapel - my seven leaf clover! I \\nknew he stole it.\\nOh, right. Plus, the magnet screws up \\nyour inhibition unit and makes you sing \\nfolk songs.\\nHm. A giant brain is basically a giant \\nnerd. And where would a giant nerd be? \\nThe libary!\\nVery impressive. Back in the 20th century \\nwe had no idea there was a university \\non Mars.\\nLook, Guenter, if you\\'re so miserable \\nhere, maybe you should just go back \\nto the jungle.\\nHe\\'s much worse. He drinks, he smokes \\nand he posts naked pictures of me on \\nthe internet.\\nWait a second. You\\'re a bender, right? \\nWe can get out of here if you just bend \\nthe bars.\\nGiant Space Robot, this is Captain Fry \\nof the USS Planet Express Ship; We come \\nin peace.\\nThis isn\\'t Yemeni! It\\'s Sulowesi!  And \\nthe cup\\'s shaking I don\\'t want my coffee \\nshaking!\\nBut, should superheroes commit crime? \\nEven to save lives? I need moral guidance. \\nBender? You jerk. I thought I was \\nyour best friend. What kind of two-timing \\nkill-mobile are you?\\nI can\\'t believe they threw me out like \\nthat. I must have been really acting \\nlike a jerk.\\nYou ate most of them. So, where\\'s Captain \\nBender? Off catastrophising some other \\nplanet?\\nOh Nibbler, at least I\\'m important to \\nyou. Even if it\\'s only \\'cause I clean \\nup you poop.\\nWell at least I did one important thing \\nwith my life. Leading good to victory \\nover evil!\\nI\\'ve got to redeem myself. Somehow, \\nsometime, for some reason. I\\'ll block \\nthis takeover!\\nYou mean we can never catch up to him? \\nNot even if we rub the engine with cheetah \\nblood?\\nWhat Bender means is, you\\'re really \\nbrave, and smart, and beautiful, and \\na great friend.\\nProfessor, please. The fate of the world \\ndepends on you getting to second base \\nwith Mom.\\nI\\'ve still got a trick or two up my \\nsleeve. Watch as I fire up through our \\nown shields.\\nWell, we\\'ll be leaving now. If you\\'ll \\njust sign this form saying you received \\nthe atom.\\nAmy, I really like you, as a friend. \\nBut I think we\\'re spending too much \\ntime together.\\nI hid it in a secret hiding place who\\'s \\nlocation I never told anyone. Not even \\nScruffy.\\nWe\\'ve been looking for you. Last we \\nheard you were under arrest as a human \\nsympathiser.\\nI know Big Vinnie said he was giving \\nme the kiss of death but I still think \\nhe was gay.\\nGo ahead. I deserve it. I wish those \\nstupid racoons had never brought me \\nto the future.\\nSure.  Y\\'know, I think I finally figured \\nout what\\'s behind all these mysterious \\ndeaths.\\nUh, I can explain that. See, it used \\nto be milk and, well, time makes fools \\nof us all.\\nHey, it\\'s your fault. He only flushed \\nhimself because your emotions made him \\nfeel bad.\\nWe\\'re gonna die! It\\'s every man for \\nhimself!  Help me, Leela!  You did it! \\nWe\\'re safe!\\nI\\'m too scared to find my pocket. Here, \\nI\\'ll just take of my pants and give \\nyou those.\\nOh, no, I\\'m boned! I haven\\'t paid into \\nthe pension either. What\\'ll I do when \\nI retire?\\nIf I were in charge I wouldn\\'t treat \\nyou like this. You\\'re nothing but a \\nbig blowhard. I know, we seem like a perfect match, but I just don\\'t feel that way about\\n        her.\\nWell, I don\\'t remember any of that but \\nI don\\'t have the wherewithal to defend \\nmyself.\\nAh, so the real gift Spargle gave you \\nwas confidence. The confidence to be \\nyour best.\\nHey, pretty nice for a single. Two desks, \\ntwo chairs, a couple of beds.  A woodpecker. Yeehah! Bow before your master, \\npuny mortals! Whoo! Giddy-up! Ha ha! \\nWoohoo! Whoopie!\\nUh, listen, is there maybe some way \\nwe could do this with you going and \\nme not going?\\nDon\\'t girl me with that girl stuff. \\nBender and me are guys. Guys don\\'t have \\nfeelings.\\nGoodbye, friends. I never thought I \\nwould die like this. But I\\'d always \\nreally hoped.\\nYeah, well, I did open the account over \\na thousand years ago. What about my \\nATM card?\\nPine needles. Oh, man, this is great! \\nHey, as long as you don\\'t make me smell \\nUranus. I\\'ll tell them you went out prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead\\n        finger.\\nHank Aaron XXIV? How could you play \\nso blowfully? The original Hank Aaron \\nwas great!\\nOK crow, prepare to be scared.  And \\nthen - honk honk - the car honked it\\'s \\nown horn!\\nUh, maybe we should stick with people \\nwe know and trust. I mean, Flexo\\'s great \\nbut -\\nIt\\'s no use. We\\'ve been to ever scuzzy \\nbazaar in the galaxy, including Pottery \\nBarn.\\nMan, it\\'s a total sty! For the first \\ntime in a thousand years, I feel like \\nI\\'m home.\\nIt was called...let me think. It was \\nreally famous - Ruth Gordon had one. \\nThe wheel!\\nYou know what movies average out to \\nbe really good? The first six Star Trek \\nmovies!\\nCome on! Remember that episode where \\nyou go high on spores and smacked Kirk \\naround?\\nNope. Not vaccinated either! Besides. \\nIt\\'s not like one vote ever made a difference.\\nEck! This emotional display is making \\nme nauseous.  Or maybe it\\'s whatever \\nthat is.\\nYou deserve it. I mean, nobody ever \\nstops to tell you what a great captain \\nyou are.\\nNope, uh-uh, eww!  Now look, this is \\nthe nose we want. Did you sell it to \\nsomebody?\\nWh-What if we helped you get your passion \\nback without the hassle of mutilating \\nme?\\nWait a second! That\\'s my name! Good \\nLord. He ditched his goofy name and \\nstole mine!\\nOK, my friends. Get ready for the most \\ndelicious extinct animal you\\'ve ever \\ntasted. It\\'s so hot \\nI poured McDonalds Coffee in my lap \\nto cool off.  Jonny Carson said it.\\nYeah, but I guess I\\'d be kinda angry \\ntoo if I had to go to some uninhabited \\nplanet.\\nGo ahead. Just chuck it any old place \\nlike I used to. Your city is counting \\non you.\\nOK sheesh!  What happened to me, Philip \\nJ. Fry, on the night of December 31st \\n1999?\\nAnd we can tie these caterpillars together \\nto make bow strings for bows and arrows. Good, \\'cause I consider my fake relationship with you a lot more\\n        meaningful. Oh, look, I\\'m not actually interested in her if that\\'s what\\'s bothering\\n        you.\\nYo, hook me up. My turkey is dry and \\nI\\'ve tried everything.  Oh right. Never \\nmind.\\nI\\'m gonna be a science-fiction hero, \\njust like Uhura, or Captain Janeway, \\nor Xena!\\nThese are the candidates? They sound \\nlike clones.  Wait a minute. They are \\nclones!\\nEh she sure is pretty. You ought to \\nmarry her and father some children right \\naway!\\nLook! Slurm! Finally!  Oh, yeah! I\\'m \\nnever going 12 minutes without a Slurm \\nagain.\\nJeez, we\\'re already planning to spend \\nValentine\\'s Day together. Isn\\'t that \\nenough?\\nCertainly yes us! Uh-huh, sir! We\\'ve \\ngotta bring back the kind of Xmas I \\nremember.\\nCorrection. We\\'re unemployed but we \\nhave a doddering old relative to mooch \\noff of.\\nI find this post-apocalyptic wasteland \\nvery confusing. Seriously, I\\'m weirded \\nout.\\nOh wow. It\\'s like that drug trip I saw \\nin that movie when I was on that drug \\ntrip.\\nLet\\'s see what tools we\\'ll need.  Uh-huh, \\nUh-huh,  Uh-huh! Alright, we\\'re all \\nset.\\nI\\'m not a little kid, Leela. I grew \\nup in this city. These are my people. \\nWhat up?\\nThat\\'s the saltiest thing I\\'ve ever \\ntasted. And I once a big heaping bowl \\nof salt!\\nAnd the professor\\'s a senile, amoral \\ncrackpot.  Hermes is a Rastafarian accountant.\\nCome on, come on! Hey Leela, how \\'bout \\na kiss for good luck?  I meant tongue \\nluck.\\nPhil wins! Yancy\\'s fans are stunned! \\nThere\\'ll be no celebration at the Yancy \\ndome!\\nI refuse to testify on the grounds that \\nmy organs will be chopped up into a \\npatt�.\\nThat was pretty cool. I think I\\'m actually \\nstarting to get interested in politics.\\nYeah keep laughing brineshrimp but he\\'s \\nbad news. I regret ever running him \\nover.\\nWell, sure. To the extent a man can \\nlove a woman. But this seems like a \\nbig step.\\nLeela!  You shouldn\\'t be listening. \\nI-I don\\'t want you to hear it \\'til it\\'s \\ndone.\\nHe\\'s so cute! He can do two things at \\none time: Eat and swim. Ooo - three \\nthings.\\nI\\'m real sorry I missed the mission. \\nI wasn\\'t there and you might have needed \\nme.\\nI\\'m at the input console. I\\'m a little \\nnervous and I\\'ve got brain in my buttcrack.\\nAlright, I\\'ll take the 500 lizards. \\nNo, wait, yes. No. Yes. Yes. Yes! The \\nparrot!\\nWell? How are they?  Oh, they\\'re great! \\nThey\\'re like sex! Except I\\'m having \\nthem!\\nAnd also - for some reason - the letter \\nI wrote you full of my personal feelings.\\nHey, you know who loves secluded picnics \\nwith just you and me?  Uh, Dr. Zoidberg.\\nHey, I can get a date too. Now that \\nI\\'m single, I\\'ll attract all sorts of \\nwomen!\\nMr. Shore, I loved you in Bio-Dome. \\nYou sure caused some trouble in that \\nbubble!\\nAlright, fine. Everything else sucks. \\nAt least we can have a nice place to \\nlive.\\nBender, if you say the A-word and you\\'ll \\nblow this planet straight to the H-word!\\nC\\'mon, Leela, why won\\'t you go out with \\nme? We both know there\\'s something there.\\nHere\\'s the entrance.  From this moment \\non I declare my bad luck officially \\nover.\\nOh, no, my ATM card! My secret PIN number! \\n1077. I\\'ve got nothing left. Except...\\nBeing captain is obviously more important \\nto you than being my friend. I\\'m going.\\nAll this time we thought he was a powerful \\nsuper-being, yet he was just a child.\\nNow let us each remember the best things \\nabout Bender in our own way. Professor?\\nHey, you know what always cheers you \\nup? Baking me a nice tray of sugar cookies!\\nYep. My friend\\'s cousin\\'s caseworker \\nsaw one once. It\\'s a widely-believed \\nfact.\\nThat\\'s it! I\\'m gonna deliver a gift \\nof my boot up Santa\\'s chimney. Where \\nis he?\\nYou guys are crazy. Leela doesn\\'t need \\nsurgery. You look great the way you \\nare.\\nCheck it out everyone. I\\'m back from \\nhell and I\\'ve got the Robot Devil\\'s \\nhands!\\nMy roommate exploded. Oh, you gotta \\nhelp me, Bender. How can I prove I\\'m \\nhuman?\\nPsst. There\\'s that robot child actor \\nwho grew up an robbed a convenience \\nstore!\\nThis is awesome! I\\'ve been waiting a \\nthousand years to see a Beastie Boys \\nshow.\\nMightiness? Are you off your nut? I \\njust got kidnapped by a bunch of guineapigs.\\nThere\\'s this girl who I really like \\nbut she thinks I\\'m a jerk. Can you help \\nme?\\nWait. In my time, we had a way of moving \\nthings long distances without hovering.\\nYeah I\\'m a little confused too. How \\ndo I ... y\\'know ... with the tail and \\nall?\\nOK, but what are the Brain Slugs who \\ncontrol you gonna do for the working \\nman?\\nOne year later I got beat up at a Neil \\nDiamond concert by a guy named Scrunchy!\\nIn the woods, I was walking. For Bigfoot, \\nlooking and then aliens beamed me up.\\nWow! That ice dispenser\\'s so big, the \\nice crushes you!  Yakov Smirnov said \\nit!\\nI think the leak\\'s stopping itself. \\nWait. Wait. Yeah, there we go. Wait. \\nYeah!\\nThis junk isn\\'t garbage! I can dig in \\nany random pile and find something great.\\nIt\\'s been two weeks. You wanna play \\ntic-tac-toe again before we eat our \\nshoes?\\nLook, I\\'m trying to save someone here. \\nI\\'ll have to come back for those later.\\nYou know, Umbriel, these last 24 hours \\nhave been the happiest days of my life.\\nLeela could beat that. She\\'s pitched \\nher whole career without getting an \\nout.\\nHe\\'s alive!  Bender. What was it like \\nlying in that hole for a thousand years?\\nI didn\\'t find him here 10 minutes ago \\nso I thought it was time to check again.\\nYeah, well, good luck. It\\'d take some \\nkind of genius to count all those rings.\\nHurry! We\\'ve gotta think of another \\nway to save Bender or Xmas will be ruined!\\nSo you\\'re saying these aren\\'t the decaying \\nruins of New York in the year 4000?\\nHey, wait! I\\'m having one of those things. \\nYou know? A headache with pictures?\\nWhoa! Check out that guy. He makes Speedy \\nGonzales look like Regular Gonzales.\\nWho cares? We\\'re 35 points ahead with \\ntwo minutes left. What could possibly \\n-\\nWords. Nothing sweet, sweet words that \\nturn into bitter orange wax in my ears.\\nDamn! I knew you wouldn\\'t have asked \\nunless it was really high or really \\nlow.\\nOh that\\'s also for Seymour. I\\'m getting \\neverything ready for when he\\'s cloned.\\nSeriously, I can\\'t think of anything. \\nGotta find something to make me think. \\n\\nWow! I love you guys! Back in the 20th \\ncentury, I had all five of your albums.\\nIn the hospital. The ambulance brought \\nyou here right after the bee stung you.\\nBut we have to! The world needs Star \\nTrek to give people hope for the future.\\nThis was the storage room. My dad spent \\nyears turning it into a bomb shelter.\\nHurry, the Golden Gate Bridge. Put the \\nmetal to the pedal to the other metal.\\nThis company\\'s on the fast track to \\nthe It List! Blast back kudos all around!\\nI\\'m experienced at foraging. I used \\nto find edible mushrooms on my bath \\nmat.\\nIt doesn\\'t matter how many human females \\nyou have, Bender\\'s on a hot streak.\\nIt\\'s crazy! How could they even know \\nabout a show from a thousand years ago?\\nAlright, don\\'t get your panties in a \\nknot. We\\'ll just use the back-up dolly.\\nNah. If I ever wanna go back to the \\nyear 2000 I\\'ll just freeze myself again.\\nBut why were you wearing that scarf, \\nthat turtleneck and this fruity number? It\\'s working, they think \\nwe\\'re making out.  Wait, why aren\\'t \\nwe making out?\\nYou\\'re not gonna believe this but they \\nlanded an amusement park on the moon!\\nOh the fools! If only they\\'d built it \\nwith 6001 hulls! When will they learn?\\nYou mean you have to choose between \\na life without sex and a gruesome death?\\nLook, so we\\'re not millionaires. At \\nleast we all still get to work together!\\nBender, I really hope that\\'s you. \\'Cause \\nif it isn\\'t......we\\'re in trouble!\\nThat\\'s so interesting. Maybe we could \\nget to know each other over a coffee.\\nLook, I know Flexo\\'s your friend but \\nI don\\'t trust him alone with the atom.\\nYeah well here\\'s a funny joke. I\\'m gonna \\nsit right here till it\\'s my shift.\\nSo, while you\\'re on the Probulator, \\ntell me, what brings you to the future?\\nThere\\'s no denying it: The future\\'s \\ncrazy! Oh, well. Don\\'t wanna stand out.\\nSo, what is Freedom Day? Sounds like \\nsome kind of feminine hygiene product.\\nHow did I do it? How did I get Leela \\nto love me? I\\'ve got to figure it out.\\nThanks. These aren\\'t pockets they\\'re \\njust flaps. I put my money in my sock.\\nStupid slug. I\\'ve never been so thirsty. \\nOh, come on! Go down already!  Ah!\\nHey, why are those kids following you? \\nDo you have candy stuck to your ass?\\nI hope it\\'s a lager so I can take it \\nto a ball game.  Ooo! I felt that one!\\nBender! Leela! Don\\'t leave me. Wait \\na minute! Hey, buddy what year is this?\\nProfessor, I\\'ve never seen you so cheerful. \\nWhat the hell\\'s wrong with you? Negative. I must \\nbe a robot. Why else would human women \\nrefuse to date me?\\nI think it was just an airport. They \\nhad a place where you could buy nuts.\\nHey! How come when I wanna do fun stuff \\nthat\\'ll kill me you\\'re against it?\\nHe must have used a sleep ray on me. \\nSleep rays exist in the future right? Face \\nit, I\\'m a prize catch.  I mean, I\\'m \\npulling down delivery boy money.\\nAh! Bathtub eggnog! Just the way Grandma \\nused to drink.  Ew! It went sour!\\nBut don\\'t you see? Fear has brought \\nus together. That\\'s the magic of Xmas!\\nHey, now that you\\'re in the future, \\nyou can go live in an actual bio-dome!\\nNowadays, people aren\\'t interested in \\nart that\\'s not tattooed on fat guys.\\nUh, greetings, Moon Man, we come in \\npeace. I am Fry from the planet Earth.\\nYou\\'re smart, you\\'re beautiful, and \\nbest of all, you\\'ll go out with me-ee?\\n\\'Cause he was a loner who hated the \\npopular monsters yet longed to be one.\\nDownload a celebrity from the internet? \\nWhat part of that do I understand?\\nShe does too! She\\'s loaded with meat! \\nShe\\'s got more meat than a cow!  Ow!\\nI hope Satan has a nice colon, \\'cause \\nthat\\'s where you\\'re gonna be living!\\nYes! I\\'m free!  Alright, Brain. Get \\nready for some electroshock treatment!\\nBut instead of falling in and getting \\nfrozen, I missed and wanged my head.\\nUh, Leela, I think there might be something \\nwrong with the coffee machine.\\nI didn\\'t ask for a completely reasonable \\nexcuse. I asked you to get busy.\\nI guess he realised I was right when \\nI told him to go back to the jungle.\\nHermes has all the fun. Wait a second! \\nHe\\'s got a Brain Slug on his head!\\nLet\\'s go microwave, I\\'m in a hurry here! \\nHm?  Hey, what smells like blue?\\nMan, we\\'ve been skipping for hours. \\nI need to pull over and take the wiz.\\nHey! This is from Miller\\'s Outpo - uh, \\nI mean, yeah, I work here alright!\\nI don\\'t like this place. It\\'s 120 degrees \\nand there\\'s very little oxygen.\\nSo, is it true that alligators flushed \\ndown the toilet survive down here?\\nLeela, is the person that parrot is \\nmimicking telling the truth by proxy?\\nThis is the best movie I\\'ve ever seen. \\nIt has a vampire and an explosion!\\nYeah, but he might get kind of upset. \\nI don\\'t think I can do that to him.\\nWell, this place has everything except \\nthe only thing I care about: A TV.\\nWell could you do it some place else? \\nI\\'m setting up Seymour\\'s doggy bed.\\nWait. We could hide you! We\\'ll pile \\nfruit on you and claim you\\'re a bowl.\\nCome on, it\\'ll be fun! Maybe we could \\neven drink a little fortified wine.\\nLeela! Oh, my God! You saved my life. \\nI am gonna get you so many lizards.\\nAnd if that doesn\\'t work, I got you \\na six-pack of champagne and a funnel.\\nHe\\'s so proud of his awful cooking. \\nIf we don\\'t eat it he\\'ll be crushed.\\nI had the Professor analyse the alienese \\nletter that was found with you.\\nWell, it took an hour to write. I thought \\nit would take an hour to read.\\nWell just let me know if there\\'s anything \\nI can do to make it up to you.\\nYeah, it\\'s like we feel the same way \\nabout junk and stuff, or, whatever.\\nWell, the doctor says I\\'m as healthy \\nas a crab. Can I go into space now?\\nHmm, I\\'m not sure we want to pay for \\na dimension we\\'re not going to use.\\nBut it\\'s a useless antenna. It\\'s not \\nlike he\\'s a ham radio or something.\\n71st street? Hmm, never heard of it. \\nDowntown could be in any direction.\\nSo that\\'s where my clover is? Hey, is \\nthat orbitting cemetary near here?\\nThat sounds like me but, I thought I \\ngot frozen. Wasn\\'t I in the future?\\nTake that! And that! This sentence I \\ndon\\'t understand but take this one!\\nEurgh! I can\\'t believe how fat I look! \\nAw, Nibbler\\'s there. Wait! What?!\\nSo then my chair tilted back and I almost \\nfell into this freezer thingy.\\nAlright. But I need a weapon to fight \\noff drunken robots when I wake up.\\nPeople, I won\\'t let you enter. Popplers \\nare as intelligent as you or me.\\nOh, I don\\'t know.  Hey, Professor, what \\nare you teaching this semester?\\nMy God! This mean the flying saucer \\nthat crashed in Roswell...was...us!\\nIt\\'s impossible! I mean, if she\\'s my \\ngrandmother, who\\'s my grandfather?\\nI can\\'t stop eating this delicious ooze. \\nBut I\\'m not gonna let you die. \\nBoy, this heater is incredible! I\\'d \\nbetter turn up the A.C. some more.\\nNo I mean the singed flesh, I can smell \\nit!  Those lilacs on the table.\\nAw, relax buddy. You were probably just \\nshooting some big, fuzzy craps.\\nOh, man. I had no idea. If only I knew \\nwhere he was I\\'d go talk to him.\\nShe\\'ll never help me. She\\'s still mad \\nthat I told her never to help me.\\nThe address was on Dogdoo 8 but the \\nuniverse ends right after Dogdoo 7!\\nI\\'m taking him home and I\\'d like to \\nsee anyone try and stop me.  Uh-oh!\\nIf anyone wants to tell me what\\'s going \\non here, I\\'ll be in the lounge.\\nSo I\\'m really back? That\\'s exactly what \\nI wanted, I guess. Who are you?\\nWell, I\\'m down to my last lottery ticket. \\nCherry.  Cherry!  Mule. Crud!\\nDon\\'t listen to them, Leela. People \\nsaid I was dumb, but I proved them.\\nWouldn\\'t a solid gold fiddle weigh hundreds \\nof pounds and sound crummy?\\nWait a minute. Bender\\'s name isn\\'t Bonder, \\nit\\'s Bender. You\\'re a fraud!\\nLook, Leonard, we\\'re light enough to \\nkeep the tapes! Isn\\'t that great?\\nWhat the hell\\'s going on? I thought \\nyou were anti-dirty not pro-dirty.\\nYou\\'re right. Nothing is over so long \\nas there\\'s one thin ray of hope.\\nAh, Leela\\'s not that bad. I just wish \\nshe didn\\'t make us work so much.\\nCoffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee \\ncoffee coffee coffee coffee!\\nWe called it first. Besides, this place \\nkinda feels like a \"B\" y\\'know?\\nBigfoot! He\\'s real! I knew it. The Loch \\nNess Monster\\'s book was right!\\nIt\\'s kinda cramped in here. I don\\'t \\neven have room to hang my clothes.\\nThen what if we shared a sleigh ride \\nacross the ice fields of Hiperia?\\nHey! Stephen Hawking! Aren\\'t you that \\nphysicist that invented gravity? He always wanted to drift forever. \\nBut through the American Southwest.\\nAnd all you had to put up with was one \\nreally annoying Star Trek fan.\\nI\\'m dying of thirst. Grab my feet and \\ndunk my head in so I can drink.\\nAmy, what I\\'m trying to say is, I think \\nmaybe you and I should stop--\\nMighty sir, we have nowhere to go. Could \\nwe please join your society?\\nFancy cigar why don\\'t you smoke it already? \\nPuff puff go go go go go!\\nOh Lucy! You\\'re just like I always thought \\nyou\\'d be from your movies.\\nI can\\'t please Leela no matter what \\nI do! I just want her to like me. Here lies Philip J. Fry, named \\nfor his uncle, to carry on his spirit.\\nSo you\\'re telling me they broadcast \\ncommercials into people\\'s dreams?\\nAt least I have friends on the outside. \\nBender\\'s been no help at all.\\nWait a minute! I know what\\'s going on \\nhere. You\\'ve all become idiots!\\nHe promised he\\'d give his Uncle Zoid \\na million bucks to make a movie.\\nHey, I wonder if these guys are here \\nto watch the erotic display too.\\nI\\'m so lonely since I came to the future. \\nWill you be my friend?  Ow!\\nWait a second! Maybe your futuristic \\nXmas isn\\'t so rotten after all.\\nNo not yet. How \\'bout we go look for \\nthe original moon landing site?\\nIt could have been. But chances were \\nequally good it was an Emperor.\\nGee, you think so, Captain? I\\'d better \\ncheck with my Prime Minister.\\nHey wait a second. How did you deliver \\na million papers in one hour?\\nMy hands. My horrible human hands.  \\nAnd what did you do to my nails?\\nI am so unlucky! I\\'ve run over black \\ncats that were luckier than me.\\nWell I\\'d like to see you try and steal \\nthis. the septuple head spin.\\nWe wanted to show you that we really \\ndo respect your robot heritage.\\nListen Leela, let me make it up by taking \\nyou out to dinner tonight.\\nI thought your duty was to cast the \\ntie-breaking vote in the Senate. Oh, I was confused because the \\nscoreboard says something different.\\nWhy would robots vote for Nixon now \\nthat he\\'s just a head in a jar?\\nSo uh, Flexo. Sorry about crushing your \\nbody like that. You OK now?\\nWait, I don\\'t like the sound of that. \\nLet\\'s just go alphabetically.\\nBoy, this A.C. is incredible!  I\\'d better \\nturn on the heater too.  \\nBut the air\\'s green and there\\'s no sign \\nof civilisation whatsoever.\\nWow! Nude hot-tubbing? That\\'s all I \\nneed to hear about Freedom Day!\\nI\\'ll just start you off with some bread. \\nSome sexy, arousing bread!\\nMy God, he\\'s gonna do it! Everybody, \\nseatbelts to maximum buckling.\\nI\\'ll miss you Leela. I\\'ll come ack and \\nvisit when I\\'m all grown up.\\nLeela, I\\'m through making fun of women. \\nNow I want them to help me.\\nI could if you hadn\\'t turned on the \\nlights and shut off the stereo.\\nMan, even the news monster is acting \\nstrange. What are we gonna do?\\nWhat are you talking about? There\\'s \\nall kinds of robots down there.\\nSo let me get this straight: This planet \\nis completely uninhabited?\\nNo, no, I think I\\'ll just smell around \\na bit over here!  Hmm.  Hmm.\\nSo this thing\\'s gonna destroy the whole \\ncity?  What the heck is it?\\nNope, I\\'m better than ever. Before the \\naccident I couldn\\'t do this!\\nOK, OK, don\\'t worry. The love meister \\nwill take you under his wing. Stop! The robot\\'s not your \\nenemy! He\\'s just a poor, misunderstood--\\nYes I did Leels! And I\\'ll tell you why. \\nBecause it grows the brand.\\nSorry everyone but need I remind you? \\nBlood is thicker than water.\\nYour Mayorness, if you execute him, \\nyou have to execute all of us.\\nIts my old neighbourhood. Man, this \\nbrings back a lot of memories.\\nAlright, alright. If it\\'ll make you \\nhappy, I\\'ll overthrow society.\\nKif touched everybody there. Couldn\\'t \\nany one of us be the mother?\\nOoh, ooh, ooh, put me in, professor. \\nI wanna show Leela my skills.\\nBut what if he wants to, I mean if he \\ntries to...uh...Barry White?\\nNot physically. But why don\\'t you ask \\nyour new best friend, Leela?\\nUh huh. And I guess now maybe I can \\nget to know the real Lucy Liu.\\nHmm, I can see where that would be an \\nadvantage. Do you take cash?\\nYou take that back! She does not look \\ngood for a truck stop chick!\\nNot yet commander. Yancy\\'s just trying \\nto steal my stuff as usual.\\nWow, way to tell that guy off. Now what\\'s \\nyour secret escape plan?\\nAnd there\\'s a robot scratching post. \\nYou should try it out Bender.\\nAw, you look so sad. You want me to \\nsend Patch Cord Adams back in?\\nLeela let\\'s turn back. There\\'s absolutely \\nno shame in wussing out. Once, not \\nfar from here, four people set out on \\na cattle drive--\\nBut this is HDTV. It\\'s got better resolution \\nthan the real world!\\nAh, just like my dad used to make ... \\nuntil McDonald\\'s fired him.\\nI don\\'t care. I\\'m staying. I\\'ve got \\neverything I want right here.\\nI\\'m on it. And maybe I\\'ll find those \\nmagic words while I\\'m at it. Strike him out Leela! Do \\nit for the hundreds of women everywhere!\\nIs that anything like a cemetary \\'cause \\nI gotta take a leak.  Ow!\\nHey, aren\\'t you supposed to be eating \\nour brains? You\\'re mutants.\\nAh, I just wish Slurms MacKenzie were \\nhere to enjoy this with me.\\nLet\\'s just forget about the box. The \\nProfessor said to stay away.\\nLook, Leela, I\\'m sorry. I never should \\nhave dragged you out here. Because when we\\'re together \\nin here, baby, time will stand still.\\nYay my buddy\\'s home! And his respect \\nfor women is back to normal.\\nHey, Project Satan! Over here! I\\'m \\na blind pedestrian. 20 points!\\nCan you believe it Bender? I\\'m going \\nto have my best friend back!\\nYeah! I don\\'t know why but my life really \\nturned around that day!\\nUh, excuse me? I missed a few lectures. \\nUh, what subject is this?\\nThat doesn\\'t look like an \"L\" at all. \\nUnless you count lowercase.\\nI don\\'t belong here, Bender. This is \\nan asylum for insane robots!\\nDon\\'t worry, Professor, it\\'s no competition \\nfor your death clock.\\nAlright, she\\'s all restocked with emergency \\njam. Let\\'s get going.\\nHey! I can get any girl I want anytime \\nI want. I\\'m just too busy.\\nLeela! That\\'s the second billboard you\\'ve \\ncrashed into this week!\\nWait! If they mean that much to you, \\nwhy do you wanna kill them?\\nFix it fix it fix it fix it fix it fix \\nit! Fix it fix it fix it!\\nIncredible. This place is just like \\nthe Ancient Egypt of my day.\\nHey, uh, what\\'s with all the pots and \\npans? You building a wife?\\nThat\\'s weird. It\\'s another Cyclops, \\nonly this one has five eyes.\\nNo wonder you\\'ve been staying at the \\nback of conga lines lately.\\nOh, hey, Leela, uh, can I talk to you \\nfor a minute?  In private?\\nMy God! She\\'s gone. Everyone I ever \\nknew or cared about is gone.\\nTangled up Christmas lights! We can \\ntake shifts untangling them!\\nThose Swedes sure know how to put in \\nalmost everything you need. Alright. I give up. I guess \\nI\\'ll just go home and marry a skunk.\\nBut have they seen your...y\\'know...physique, \\nsince the old days?\\nC\\'mon Bender let\\'s go. This chick flick \\nis getting me all barfy. Yes! He chose me! He\\'s trying \\nto kill me! Leela, I\\'m so happy!   Affirmative. I feel \\nnothing. I am a robot. Beep, beep, beep \\n... C\\'mon, Bender. If you\\'re \\ndone scamming Beck, we\\'re heading home.\\nI did it!  And it\\'s all thanks to the \\nbooks at my local library.\\nJamaican? I thought you were some kinda \\nouter space potato man. This is great! I haven\\'t had time off since I was 21 through 24.\\nBut we\\'re about to take off. We gotta \\neat our blastoff sundaes.\\nThis contest is as good as over. I once \\ncaught a fish this big.\\nI tell you, being here really takes \\nme back to my college days.\\nYou couldn\\'t have picked a better time \\nto dump the ship Bender!\\nC\\'mon Leela you deserve better than \\nthis guy! Dump him already!\\nWell, whatever it is, it\\'s even better \\nfresh.  Mmm, still warm.\\nI care! I care plenty! I just don\\'t \\nknow how to make them stop!\\nOh, so all of a sudden we\\'re spending \\nValentine\\'s Day together?\\nWell, we destroyed the toy spaceship. \\nNow what are we gonna do?\\nLets go check it out. You can see how \\nI lived before I met you.\\nSo do I get Seymour back? Are you caving \\nto political pressure?\\nI don\\'t think so.  Sir, I believe you \\nowe this lady an apology.\\nLeela, I had worms. I needed to know \\nwho you loved. Me or them.\\nKareem\\'s got the skyhook but Philip \\nJ. Fry\\'s got the spacehook!\\nPsst, I need the apartment tonight. \\nGo see a saucy puppet show.\\nYes, I am. I simply haven\\'t discovered \\nmy primary function yet. Alcohol fuels my power cells. \\nAnd as a mighty robot, I--  Beep.\\nMan, we look stupid. We should\\'ve gotten \\nstore-bought costumes.\\nOh yeah?  Could a dream take you dancing \\nin an illusion garden?\\nSo I really am important? How I feel \\nwhen I\\'m drunk is correct?\\nThis snow is beautiful. I\\'m glad global \\nwarming never happened.\\nDon\\'t you worry about Planet Express. \\nLet me worry about blank!\\nUh wait, this is the other Fry\\'s locker. \\nI\\'m Phry with a \"Ph.\"\\nWe just wanted to show you that you \\nreally will be remembered.\\nIt\\'s like that time I peeked in the \\nkitchen at Imperial Hunan.\\nWell, it turns out I loved her, but \\nI wasn\\'t in love with her.\\nYou were mean and you yelled and you \\nmade us do all that work.\\nHey, which crazy thing happening are \\nyou guys screaming about?\\nNo I\\'m not. Mark my words. Flexo\\'s evil. \\nHe\\'s the evil Bender.\\nOr maybe, he never left at all!  Wait \\na minute. You\\'re Bender.\\nAnd another thing: You\\'re using an awful \\nlot of make-up there.\\nBut everyone is driving around in cars \\nshooting at each other.\\nOh great space king. I humbly beg you \\nto return my human horn.\\nBender, wake up!  He\\'s OK! Quick, does \\nanyone have any liquor?\\nFar out! So, there\\'s an infinite number \\nof parallel universes?\\nI\\'m sorry. I was up really late poking \\nthrough people\\'s desks.\\nHey, when you look this good, you don\\'t \\nhave to know anything.\\nIt looked good but I just don\\'t feel \\nlike eating. You want it?\\nCool! Y\\'know, I\\'ve never even seen a \\nrobot\\'s apartment before.\\nAnyway, I\\'m sure it\\'ll work out. This \\nway we\\'ll both be happy.\\nI\\'ll be fine. It\\'s not like anyone\\'s \\ngonna drink me.  Quit it!\\nI won\\'t be gone long Seymour. Just wait \\nhere \\'til I come back.\\nLeela! Stop bonding and lets go! I got \\njelly in my underpants!\\'S PHOTO\\nYou can! The Leela I know doesn\\'t give \\nup this easily.\\nYeah, it\\'s really long. But what did \\nyou just turn on with it?\\nMs Johnson, you\\'ve never lied to me. \\nAm I still a good person?\\nIt is? Yahoo! We\\'re poor no matter what \\nI do! The deal is off!\\nI knew it! Insane theories: one! Regular \\ntheories: a billion!\\nW-Wouldn\\'t it make more sense to send \\nthe robots in first a-- Ocean madness, yeah right. \\nIt\\'s always something, ain\\'t it?   \\nIt\\'s her! Bender, wake up! She\\'s here! \\nWake up!  Oh! oxygen!\\nOh, yeah?  Read it and weep. I\\'m a certified \\ncollege dropout.\\nWow\" The jungles on Mars look just like \\nthe jungles on Earth.\\nHey look! The player\\'s who broke the \\nvarious colour barriers!\\nYeah, well, you shouldn\\'t have been \\nsuch a mean captain then.\\nBender? How did the fight go? I heard \\nsomebody got flattened!\\nBut there\\'s probably some cool forbidden \\nstuff you can steal.\\nThis is crazy, Bender. How are you gonna \\nlive without a body?\\nI recognise you. Didn\\'t you used to \\nhave a body of some sort?\\nOK, OK, nevermind. I\\'ll just ask those \\npeople for directions.\\nBut she\\'ll crush you like a worm ... \\ncrushing a smaller worm.\\nWell, Amy, I\\'ll try not to interfere \\nwith your life too much.\\nThis is where I brought my girlfriend \\non our very first date.\\nC\\'mon Leela, what\\'s the real reason \\nyou won\\'t go out with me?\\nSo you flip out and start acting like \\nsome crazy folk singer?\\nI got her champagne, I opened it. What \\ndoes a guy have to do?\\nProfessy\\'s back!  Eww, you smell like \\nsmoking.  And drinking.\\nI don\\'t know. Do refrigerators still \\ncome in cardboard boxes?\\nIt\\'s tempting, but, well, I am already \\nkinda settled in here.\\nI can\\'t drink that! The metal shavings \\nmake my throat bloody.\\nI don\\'t get this. Is blernsball exactly \\nthe same as baseball?\\nBoring? Baseball wasn\\'t -- hmm, so they \\nfinally jazzed it up?\\nCool! Can I borrow the new ones? And \\na couple of blank tapes?\\nHey wait, this brain knows everything \\nabout everything right?\\nHere\\'s something. It looks like a ditch \\nfull of fried shrimp.\\nUh, jeez, don\\'t get upset. I mean, OK \\nI outwitted you, but--\\nTremble? I laugh. Nobody knows more \\nabout Star Trek than me!\\nUh wait, Bender\\'s my rooommate. He could \\nbe back any second.\\nBend-er? Doesn\\'t ring a bell.  Did you \\nhear something Leela?\\nBrunch. Right. I\\'d better warn - tell \\n- warntell the others!\\nUh, with you blocking the only escape \\nroute? Don\\'t be silly!\\nThat\\'s when we saved Earth from a giant \\nasteroid of garbage.\\nGreat, great. The one time I forgot \\nto buy flight insurance.\\nPlease, Mr. Nixon. We\\'re appealing to \\nyour sense of decency.\\nMichelle, I don\\'t regret this. But I \\nboth rue and lament it.\\nAnd remember when Mayor Giuliani cracked \\ndown on jaywalking?\\nHey, Bender. Sounds like you could use \\na little of that oil.\\nAnd there\\'s Hookerbot 5000. She\\'s got \\na heart of solid gold!\\n50 bucks?! Not even if she was my girlfriend. \\nYou take her.\\nNow these monkeys I like!  What\\'s that? \\nYou wanna come out?\\nWell I guess we\\'d better clean up these \\nmillions of hearts.\\nI\\'m telling you there\\'s something about \\nFlexo I don\\'t like.\\nOw! My head is killing me. What happened? \\nWas anybody hurt?\\nNooo!  That\\'s it I\\'m gettin\\' the hell \\noutta here.  Ooh! Ow!\\nAnd I can deliver them. Billions and \\nbillions in one night.\\nOh, can\\'t you leave me alone? I\\'m miserable \\nenough already.\\nI believe you\\'re forgetting about our \\n5% military discount.\\nThis is stupid. I\\'m taking this thing \\nout to the real moon.\\nHmm. Maybe this is the moment to show \\nher my real surprise.\\nNow me and Leela are forming an awesome \\ncrime-fighting duo.\\nWait! I\\'m usually the first guy to toot \\nmy own lower horn -\\nI once had a best friend who liked to \\nsmell things with me.\\nThese new hands are great. I\\'m gonna \\nbreak them in tonight.\\nSheesh! 40,000 channels and only 150 \\nhave anything good on.\\nI could vomit or urinate. Would you \\nfeel better about that?\\nAmazing! That\\'s why they call you \"Bender \\nThe Magnificent\"!\\n15? You mean he lived for 12 more years \\nafter I got frozen?\\nApartment 1I. The old me would have \\nmade a joke about that!\\nWhen I\\'m with you, everyday seems like \\ndouble-soup Tuesday.\\nThe car dealer? Wow! I guess his prices \\nreally were insane.\\nPft. What kind of bozos would start \\na Bender protest group?\\nHey uh Bender. What are we doing in \\nthis bad neighbourhood?\\nNo. Make up some feelings and tell her \\nyou have them.  Yes?\\nXmas, huh?  Y\\'know this\\'ll be my first \\nXmas away from home.\\nNo, I need to get her a gift. And I \\nneed it before sundown.\\nPlease let us live! We\\'ll put out milk \\nand cookies for you!\\nHey, Bender. Here\\'s an exhibit about \\nMom\\'s favourite robot.\\nNo. In fact, it looks so nice I think \\nI might get one too.\\nIt was just a dream, Bender. There\\'s \\nno such thing as two.\\nI\\'m just glad we hit something. I thought \\nwe\\'d never stop.\\nYou see? You see? Now she\\'s bothering \\nme when I\\'m at work.\\nOh, wait, it hasn\\'t started yet.  OK, \\nit\\'s about to start.\\nYou\\'re right. Let\\'s do this now and \\nlet\\'s never regret it.\\nWhere are we ever going to find a lawyer \\nto take his case?\\nOver there! Look! It\\'s the moon landing \\nsite! We found it!\\nLook. I\\'ve been studying how to pilot \\nthe ship. Impressed?\\nPlus the cream won\\'t give you superpowers, \\nyou\\'re a robot.\\nWell, so what if I love a robot? It\\'s \\nnot hurting anybody.\\nReally? I didn\\'t think he\\'d miss this \\napartment that much.\\nThis is the saddest day of my life. \\nAnd I still can\\'t cry.\\nI don\\'t know. But it might have something \\nto do with this.\\nI know, I was deliberately describing \\na similar situation.\\nNow if you\\'ll excuse me I\\'m working \\non Seymour\\'s doghouse.\\nI bet you Leela\\'s holding out for a \\nnice guy with one eye.\\nBender, I can\\'t take much more of this! \\nI want outta here!\\nOh my God! It\\'s out of ice! Like some \\nouter space Motel 6!\\nWhat just happened? Why is the ball \\non that springy thing?\\nLarger than an American sedan?  How \\nbig is the honey comb?\\nI, I don\\'t understand. You made me go \\nin the freezer tube?\\nI\\'m bored. You\\'re boring, Zoidberg. \\nI\\'m gonna go watch TV.\\nSo what\\'s the deal? You guys don\\'t believe \\nin Robot Jesus?\\nBoneitis? Pft! That\\'s a funny name for \\na horrible disease. Yeah. I\\'m never going to another planet called Cannibalon!\\nYou know what else stinks about being \\na slave? The hours. Shut up, you two! We can \\nkill ourselves when we get home!\\nAh, some good old high-gravity rain. \\nThat\\'ll cool us off.\\nRelax! She can\\'t be my grandmother! \\nI figured it all out.\\nAnd that\\'ll allow Bender to feel other \\npeople\\'s emotions?\\nOutlaw Slurm?  Uh, don\\'t pay any attention \\nto him sir ...\\nThese letters are real butt-nutters! \\nListen to this one: \\nYes! Footprints! And hand prints?  But? \\nWhat\\'s happening?\\nDude hold up! Remember when Zapp blew \\na hole in the ship?\\nWhatever\\'s in there it\\'s the only thing \\nI\\'ve ever wanted.\\nWell, I sort of a have a thing for this \\ngirl I work with.\\nThere won\\'t be a lot of long-winded \\nspeeches, will there?\\nSo will Seymour remember how to sing \\nWalking On Sunshine?\\nWell, at least I learned Leela\\'s a lost \\ncause. I give up.\\nPizza dinner on me!  Just keep the tab \\nunder $50 million.\\nBender? No way!  I definitely would\\'ve \\nnoticed something.\\nWhoa, thanks! If you ever need a saviour \\nagain, just ask.\\nDon\\'t you worry about \"blank\" let me \\nworry about \"blank.\"\\nCome on Leela, step your big boot down \\non the gas pedal.\\nYeah yeah yeah keep it comin\\' put the \\npot down get away!\\nLet\\'s just dump it in the sewer and \\nsay we delivered it.\\nWell I\\'m feelin\\' lucky!  Uh... I\\'m ready \\nto go back now.\\nThis is great Professor! We should go \\nout and celebrate!\\nWow! You guys sell every kind of meat \\nhere except human!\\nI didn\\'t mean to. He just looked so \\ncool and refreshing.\\nWell at least my assassin will get what\\'s \\ncoming to him.\\nNo, I\\'m not! Oh, wait, I am. But my \\npoint remains valid!\\nAt last! At last I have the power to \\nmake Leela love me.\\nHoly camolies! The house I grew up in! \\nIt\\'s still there!\\nI can\\'t take it anymore! They\\'ve been \\nat it for hours!  \\nProfessor, you\\'re a Professor. You must \\nhave some ideas.\\nYou are? So things aren\\'t working out \\nwith whatshisname?\\nWhat about me? Can I come back at severely \\nreduced pay?\\nHey! Now what am I supposed to watch \\nand drink all day?\\nCall it a hunch but, I\\'ve got a bad \\nfeeling about this.\\nIf those aren\\'t tears of happiness, \\nplease stop crying.\\nWell, anyway, just remember that people \\ncare about you.\\nPizza delivery! Wow, so this is a real \\nTV station, huh?\\nAnd here he is trying to make a catch \\nwith an oven mit.\\nProfessor, when did you become so obsessed \\nwith voting?\\nNow here\\'s a party I can get excited \\nabout. Sign me up!\\nSorry, but if it\\'s not here in half \\nan hour, it\\'s free.\\nZoidberg, how could you? I used to think \\nyou were cool.\\nWhich means...we can clone it! Seymour \\nwill live again!\\nI\\'m gonna get my puppy back! In your \\nface, Grim Reaper!\\nI\\'m about to.  Leela, let me play for \\nyou one for time.\\nI\\'m Philip J. Fry! He stole my name \\nafter I got frozen.\\nHey, that\\'s my old bank. Maybe my account\\'s \\nstill open.\\nWait. You\\'re Pamela Anderson! Cool! \\nWhat can I get you?\\nAh, no one likes them at first but they\\'ll \\ngrow on you.\\nWhat? I\\'ve seen you get up off your \\nback tons of times.\\nThat\\'s awful Professor. Especially the \\nmaking out part.\\nWait, I\\'m trying. It weighs as much \\nas a thousand suns!\\nThey\\'re supposed to be some kinda, you \\nknow, pine tree.\\nUm, I have a question. What if Bender \\nwas really giant?\\n...So I ask you, as a friend, won\\'t \\nyou stop this deal?\\nThis is wrong. We shouldn\\'t have abandoned \\nthem there. Then we\\'re dead meat. No one could squeeze under there!\\nSo this is where they stick old people. \\nIt\\'s horrific.\\nUnless you let us live. Then you\\'ll \\nget off scot free.\\nLeela, you beaned a run-in. You\\'d better \\nlet me pitch.\\nWell it\\'s not my fault either \\'cause \\nI forgot to vote.\\nAww I know how you feel. My grandfather \\ndied recently.\\nWait a second, I know that monkey. His \\nname is Donkey.\\nUh, look, we\\'ve got mail for Santa. \\nAre you his elves?\\nI woke you up early so we could hang \\nout and do stuff.\\nOh, Bender. You didn\\'t touch the Crushinator, \\ndid you?\\nBut in this case I just don\\'t think \\nit\\'ll do any good.\\nReally? That\\'d be great! You sure I \\nwon\\'t be imposing?\\nWhat are you doing? You totally ripped \\noff my routine.\\nStop! Take one more step and I\\'ll breathe \\nfire on you! You just wanna talk, it \\nhas nothing to do with mating.\\nI\\'ve got to do something to show Leela \\nhow sorry I am.\\nGoodbye, Leela.  Hey, look: We\\'re under \\nthe mistletoe.\\nYou believe me about the monsters, right, \\nMr. Panucci?\\n...friendship, then I\\'ll sell Planet \\nExpress, for you.\\nI can\\'t believe you\\'re really real. \\nI like your tail.\\nSorry, Zoidberg. I\\'m trying to join \\nthe country club.\\nI\\'m from the 20th century. Go ahead, \\nask me anything.\\nAnd no one will have to punish anyone \\nfor the mutiny.\\nHmm, you got any sacred artwork of her \\nfrom the back?\\nAh, I can\\'t stand to see a robot cry. \\nLet\\'s watch TV!\\nThat\\'s it, Amy, we have to talk. Zoidberg, \\nyou drive.\\nLeela? What are you guys doing here \\nin the year 4000?\\nC\\'mon! Lets go tell Leela so we can \\ngrow up together!\\n$30? I can\\'t afford that. Unless... \\nDo you take Visa?\\nOh. Kinda like how a warehouse is inhabited \\nby boxes.\\nThen where are we? You said you knew \\nhow to navigate.\\nLook out!  You want her you\\'ll have \\nto go through me.\\nWhy and I sticky and naked? Did I miss \\nsomething fun?\\nHello? Pizza delivery for uh...I. C. \\nWiener? Aw crud!\\nY\\'know that dance wasn\\'t as safe as \\nthey said it was.\\nI\\'m on it. But if you need me you know \\nwhere I\\'ll be.\\nWell, we can live without machines. \\nI was in Webelos.\\nSo what were they doing to you in that \\nawful drawer?\\nLeela, freak out later. We\\'re not done \\nescaping yet!\\nIt\\'s OK, Leela, go ahead. I got a lot \\nof work to do.\\nAlright, scumwads. This one\\'s for Bender\\'s \\ncocktail!\\nOoh ... I know this ... whatyya call \\nit? Lite Brite!\\nOh-ho you\\'d like it if I went to sleep \\nwouldn\\'t you?\\nMy God. What if the secret ingredient \\n... is people?\\nHey, I have an idea: Let\\'s all go out \\nfor ice cream.\\nSo I guess without jobs, we\\'ll be fugitives \\nforever.\\nYes! Yes! That\\'s exactly the job I\\'ve \\nalways wanted!\\nNah. I read in Newsweek that she drinks \\nhuman blood.\\nI\\'m sorry, Bender, but there\\'s just \\nnot enough room.\\nI\\'ll come visit sometime. And you can \\nvisit me here.\\nOh, stupid TV!  Bender! You\\'re blind \\nstinking sober!\\nThis is huge! Bender, why don\\'t I just \\nlive in here?\\nYeah, they get around! But I\\'m afraid \\nwe had a deal.\\nWhoa, whoa! Slow down. You\\'re going \\na mile a minute.\\nOh, right. I wonder where they smoke \\nin high school.\\nHey, wait a minute! Isn\\'t anyone going \\nto defend us?\\nReligon? Is this another scam to get \\nfree yarmulkes?\\nThen I am the most important person \\nin the universe.\\nOK, you\\'re on a date. What\\'s the first \\nthing you do?\\nOoo, a bot-mitzvah. Shalom hunger, shalom \\nfree food!\\nUh Ms Johnson? Please bring in some \\nmore chair fuel.\\nAw hey c\\'mon don\\'t worry. We\\'ll watch \\nyou clean up.\\nNo, he was a bad friend. I want him \\nback right now.\\nCrud. Can I at least be in charge of \\nyour dentures?\\nMathematics of wanton burrito meals. \\nI\\'ll be there!\\nHey hey, what\\'s wrong? Was it something \\nLeela said?\\nToo bad we gotta make that urgent popcorn \\ndelivery.\\nWell, at least now you can pay off your \\nloan shark.\\nLeela, are you alright? You got wanged \\non the head.\\nI like those odds.  Rats. Just another \\ntooth.  Aah!\\nCool, an alien! Has your race taken \\nover the Earth?\\nDelivery boy? No! Not again! Please! \\nAnything else!\\nThis is unbelievable! What do you heads \\ndo all day?\\nFull price for gum? That dog won\\'t hunt, \\nMonsignor.\\nYou wanna save him too, Lemon? You barely \\nknow him.\\nGeez Bender, you\\'re scaring me. You\\'re \\ngoing wacko!\\nHey, yeah! That sounds good. Can I give \\nyou a hand?\\nIt\\'s good to have the old weird-looking \\nLeela back.\\nWell...alright. You sure I probably \\nwon\\'t know him?\\nThank you sir, that\\'s exactly what I \\nwas going for.\\nYou are? Did you grow a moustache since \\nlast night? Ow! My head! Ow! My feet! \\nOw! My head!
